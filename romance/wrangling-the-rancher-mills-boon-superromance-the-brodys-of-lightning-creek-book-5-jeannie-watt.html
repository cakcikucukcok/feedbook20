          &lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s a thin line between aggravation and…attraction! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was definitely not part of Cole Bryan&#39;s lease agreement. The rented farm is Cole&#39;s only chance for peace and quiet…until his landlord&#39;s gorgeous, city-livin&#39; granddaughter, Taylor Evans, shows up looking for a place to stay. With nowhere else to go, Taylor isn&#39;t taking his &quot;no&quot; for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cole plans to wait her out. Taylor&#39;s obviously not made for rural life, and she can&#39;t get out of Montana soon enough. But he never counted on her grit and determination—or the unexpected pull between them. Now the only way Cole can keep to himself is by compromising his heart…&lt;/p&gt;

When she's not writing or teaching science at the local junior high, she enjoys making mosaic mirrors, sewing, and pretending that the house is neat and tidy.<br /><b><i>Wrangling the Rancher by Jeannie Watt - Goodreads</i></b> | For a Jeannie Watt book, this is 3 stars. For a Harlequin, it's four. Ms. Watt has written much better books than this (A DIFFICULT WOMAN, MADDIE INHERITS A COWBOY, ALWAYS A TEMP, etc.) Ms. Watt's usual excellent writing is here, but the book feels rushed.<br /><b><i>Wrangling the Rancher (The Brodys of Lightning Creek) Mass ...</i></b> | Title: Wrangling the Rancher (The Brodys of Lightning Creek) Author(s): Jeannie Watt ISBN: 0-373-64041-2 / 978-0-373-64041-6 (UK edition) Publisher: Harlequin Superromance Large Print<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Wrangling The Rancher (Mills &amp; Boon Superromance) (The Brodys of Lightning Creek, Book 5) - Jeannie Watt</a> </h3></p><hr/>
