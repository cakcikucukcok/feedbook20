  <title>Bedmates - Nichole Chase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of Suddenly Royal comes the first in a sparkling new series about America&amp;#8217;s favorite royal&amp;#8212;the First Daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone makes mistakes, especially in college. But when you&amp;#8217;re the daughter of the President of the United States, any little slip up is a huge embarrassment. Maddie McGuire&amp;#8217;s latest error in judgment lands her in police custody, giving the press a field day. Agreeing to do community service as penance and to restore her tattered reputation, Maddie never dreams incredibly good looking but extremely annoying vice president&amp;#8217;s son, Jake Simmon, will be along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently returning from Afghanistan with a life-altering injury, Jake is wrestling with his own demons. He doesn&amp;#8217;t have the time or patience to deal with the likes of Maddie. They&amp;#8217;re like oil and water and every time they&amp;#8217;re together, it&amp;#8217;s combustible. But there&amp;#8217;s a thin line between love and hate, and it&amp;#8217;s not long before their fiery arguments give way to infinitely sexier encounters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jake receives devastating news about the last remaining member of his unit, the darkness he&amp;#8217;s resisted for so long begins to overwhelm him. Scared to let anyone close, he pushes Maddie away. But she isn&amp;#8217;t about to give up on Jake that easily. Maddie&amp;#8217;s fallen for him, and she&amp;#8217;ll do anything to keep him from the edge as they both discover that love is a battlefield and there are some fights you just can&amp;#8217;t lose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
