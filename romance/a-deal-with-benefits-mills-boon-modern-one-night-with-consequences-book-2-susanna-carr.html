  <title>A Deal with Benefits (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (One Night With Consequences, Book 2) - Susanna Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Thirty days and thirty nights&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ashley Jones has been sitting in Sebastian Cruz’s office. For hours. Behind the imposing wooden doors sits the man who stole her family’s island home. And she wants it back.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the fight is knocked from her when Ashley recognises him as a man she knows intimately – the man who betrayed her after their blissful night together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sebastian has no intention of giving the island back, but he does want Ashley. He agrees to her deal, but has a few sub-clauses of his own. Specifically: a month at his beck and call – and in his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Fabulous characters and a&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;story full of drama…perfect!’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;– Megan, Recruitment, Enfield&lt;/p&gt;
