  <title>Men &amp; Women Can&#39;t Be Friends: A Novel - Elle Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t men and women be friends?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple; because men have dicks and women have vaginas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brilliant, right? Well don&amp;rsquo;t call me a genius yet. My name is Imogen Towns and most of my&amp;hellip;scratch that&amp;hellip;all of my relationships, or lack thereof, started out as us just being friends. Which turned into friends with benefits. Which then turned into skid marks on my driveway the minute I mentioned anything about turning our &lt;em&gt;friendship&lt;/em&gt; into an actual &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt;. So much for the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So once I finally figured out that anyone with a&amp;nbsp; set of testicles calling himself my friend really only wanted to have sex with me, I made a promise to myself to never get duped by a man again&amp;hellip;and then my literary agent called.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Apparently, my not-so bestselling book had caught the attention of People Magazine&amp;rsquo;s Sexiest Man Alive, actor Evan Miles, and he wanted to break into the directing game using my book as his jump off. Great. That&amp;rsquo;s all I needed, a playboy who&amp;rsquo;s made friends with benefits out of half the woman in Hollywood dicking around with my storyline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I should&amp;rsquo;ve told him no. I should&amp;rsquo;ve ignored the boost in sales having a celebrity attached to my book would&amp;rsquo;ve given. And I most definitely should&amp;rsquo;ve ignored the metaphorical boner I got every time Evan flexed his muscles in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trying to write a script that stayed true to my book was going to be hard. Trying to write a script with a man that could give a nun a complex and keep it strictly professional was going to be even harder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the interest of self preservation, you&amp;rsquo;d think that I&amp;rsquo;d try and avoid getting to know the man behind the larger than life persona; especially after I found out the real reason why he wanted to use my book as his directorial debut. But since befriending a man basically turns a woman into a masochist, I didn&amp;rsquo;t and now my life is a total $#!T show.&lt;/p&gt;" />
