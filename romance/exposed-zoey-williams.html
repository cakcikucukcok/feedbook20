  <title>Exposed - Zoey Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to mourn the death of a dear friend…Macy Grant&#39;s ladybits.&#39; –Concerned friend of Macy Grant&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been out of the game for so long I wonder if I still remember how to have good sex.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is it like riding a bike, something I’ll never forget how to do?” –Macy Grant, modern spinster and vibrator afficionado&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“To be honest, I haven’t seen her in years, but we were once inseparable.” –Macy Grant about her ladybits&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dating a guy with a beard is one thing. A guy who is a beard is quite another… Macy Grant hasn&#39;t sex in a long time. It&#39;s time for an intervention. Macy Grant is being set-up. She just doesn&#39;t know it… The workaholic, the beard and the problem with attraction!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been five years since event planner Macy Grant has dated. In fact, her only real relationship — outside of work — seems to be with her vibrator, Frank. Frustrated with Macy&#39;s spinstery ways, her friends stage an intervention in an attempt to rescue Macy&#39;s vagina from a life of boredom…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Macy agonizes through her first — and worst — date in years, she can&#39;t help but notice the brawny, shaggy-haired artist sitting at the next table. Handsome. Sexy. With hands that are incredibly… uh, skilled. So when Macy runs into Jake [last name?] at a party, it&#39;s a definitely a sign from the Gods Who Want Her To Get Laid. And oh, she does.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except that Jake didn&#39;t tell Macy that it&#39;s his engagement party. Or that he&#39;s a professional beard who&#39;s marrying a lesbian. Now Macy must decide whether she can walk away from the perfect guy… or if she&#39;ll risk being exposed as the other woman!&lt;/p&gt;
