  <title>The Goodbyes - Leslie Welch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Goodbyes is a moving and realistic account of the strength of an unbreakable bond, the anguish of unrequited feelings, and the wisdom attained through the highs and lows of triumph and tragedy. Told through the unique prose of debut author Leslie Welch, this story aims for the core of our emotions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Webb Turner grew up in a seemingly idyllic Pennsylvanian town, tortured by a troubled household. His young life is turned upside down by the exciting, magnetic, and wild girl next door, Bree. They keep each other at arm&amp;#39;s length their whole lives, however, dancing around the issue of their unresolved feelings while Bree&amp;#39;s life steadily spirals out of control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Webb&amp;#39;s life is on a different trajectory. He escapes the small town to become a globetrotting rock music sensation, with a new romantic interest on his mind and the past left in the rear-view mirror&amp;mdash;until he hears that Bree is dying. This shocking news unleashes a torrent of unresolved angst that won&amp;#39;t be dammed until Webb drops everything and everybody mid-tour to undertake a dangerous drive through a blizzard to be by Bree&amp;#39;s side, just for one last chance to say his final farewell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With compelling characters, an unflinchingly realistic small-town setting, and emotionally sensitive prose, author Leslie Welch weaves a story that lingers in the mind long after the cover is closed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
