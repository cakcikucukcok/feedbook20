  <title>Tabora and the Plight of a Black Butterfly - Roy E. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Tabora inherited the large sum of money, and then later became deeply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;entrenched in a steamy relationship with Sara, her childhood friend; life for her was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but a dream. Sara, on the other hand, was saturated with hidden agendas. With surgical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;precision she maintained a network of . . . outside friends throughout the DMV. When&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina entered her life, however, she brought with her a maze of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutally cunning, she had set her sights on Sara, and nothing was beneath her if it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would usher in what she desired. If Tina succeeds in wooing Sara, Tabora could find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;herself forced to resort to other means of satisfying her highly potent sexual needs. It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;becomes complicated for all three women when marred relationships create a climate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of greed, jealousy, and revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drama between the threesome will lead you on a thrilling journey of emotional,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suspenseful, and down-right cut-throat action. There is a roller-coaster of sex, lust, love,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lies, betrayal, and murder. Give Tabora a read. You will agree: this novel is gripping;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a page turner. Its real-life drama thats suspenseful to the very end. Its all for your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;entertainment pleasure. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
