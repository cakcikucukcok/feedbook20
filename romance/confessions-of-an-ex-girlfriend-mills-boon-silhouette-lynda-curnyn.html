  <title>Confessions Of An Ex-Girlfriend (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Lynda Curnyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-Girlfriend Emma Carter has a lot on her mind. Her boyfriend got a life–in L.A.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her hairdresser found God. And that extra ten pounds of &quot;relationship flab&quot; she acquired while falling in love with a commitment-phobe has just put her out of the running for new romance–or so she thinks. But before Emma can get on with her life, she&#39;s got to face a few startling truths about being single in New York City….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confession #5: Marriage suddenly seems like a social disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the latest bride in my family–my mother–has put me to work in the service of her wedding day. What about us non-brides-to-be? Working in the warped little world of wedding planning has only led me to one conclusion: If you don&#39;t get married in this world, you get nothing. Once, in an editorial meeting, I jokingly suggested that a woman should get a bridal shower when she turns thirty, wedding or not. Everyone looked at me as if I were some kind of nut. I am 31 years old; am I not entitled to free Calphalon yet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Who ever thought that baring your soul could be this good?&lt;/p&gt;
