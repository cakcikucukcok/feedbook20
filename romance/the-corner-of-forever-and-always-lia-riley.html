      <meta name="description" content="Fairy tales aren&#39;t ever what they seem . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Tuesday Knight&#39;s dream of Broadway stardom has flopped, leaving her unemployed and brokenhearted. Ready to quit kissing frogs and make her own happily-ever-after, she takes a job as a princess in Everland, Georgia&#39;s historical amusement park. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Mayor Beau Marino lives an unenchanted existence-all work, no play-which is fine by him. After his marriage ended in disaster, the last thing he wants in his life is more drama. But Everland&#39;s new free spirit has a talent for getting under his starched collar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When the town&#39;s beloved but bankrupt park might be shut down, Tuesday and Beau face a choice. Can they join forces, save the day-and each other? Or will their fierce battle of wills destroy any chance of a fairy-tale ending?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors Kristan Higgins, Jill Shalvis, and Marina Adair, comes the second book in Lia Riley&#39;s Everland, Georgia series about two city sisters finding love in a small town." />
