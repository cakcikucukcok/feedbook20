  <title>The Secret Ingredient for a Happy Marriage - Shirley Jump</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Shirley Jump comes a heartwarming tale about friendship, family, and the unbreakable bond between sisters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  THE SECRET INGREDIENT FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nora has always been the sister who binds the O&#39;Bannons together. No matter what crisis hits, smart, dependable Nora knows how to fix it. But for Nora, the pressure of perfection is taking its toll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nora&#39;s marriage is in trouble, and she has been reluctant to worry her sisters with just how dire her situation is. Now though, faced with losing her husband, her home, and the life she&#39;s worked so hard to build, Nora can no longer pretend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As the O&#39;Bannon women rally around her, Nora begins to see that failure is nothing to fear. It&#39;s like they say in the bakery: if you want to make something good, you can&#39;t be afraid to get messy. When her husband returns, asking Nora to give their family a second chance, Nora must decide if their relationship can be saved-or if it&#39;s time to throw out the old recipe and start from scratch." />
