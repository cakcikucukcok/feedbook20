      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;To kiss a royal&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Grand Serenity’s goodwill ambassador, Princess Samantha DeSaunters lives a dazzling, high-profile life. Her own romantic dreams come second to her devotion to her island realm. Until she impulsively kisses a sexy stranger at a political gala. Now the reticent royal can’t get enough of Garrison Montgomery, the former soldier hired to keep her and the throne safe. But who’ll protect Sam from yearning to turn their mock courtship into the real thing?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the Caribbean to run security for the ruling family, Gary instead finds himself caught up in a sizzling forbidden affair that could sabotage his mission. As he and Sam share passionate secret nights that make him forget about his past, the threat against the DeSaunters escalates. Can Gary protect Sam from the enemies out to destroy the crown, and hold onto the chance at happily-ever-after with his princess?&lt;/p&gt;
