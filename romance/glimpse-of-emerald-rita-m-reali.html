  <title>Glimpse of Emerald - Rita M. Reali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All his life, every woman who was important to Gary had a way of leaving, at the most inopportune time: through death, desertion &amp;ndash; even amid deception. Through it all, the one constant was the unwavering love and faith-driven support of Edward, his beloved grandfather. But one day &amp;ndash; all too soon &amp;ndash; that love and support is suddenly stripped away, when the old man dies. Now all Gary has left is memories &amp;ndash; and his granddad&amp;#39;s rosary beads, which Edward had been clutching when he died. Plus, as the young man soon learns, a tidy fortune and a beach house on the Connecticut shore. In trying to cope with his emptiness and grief, Gary throws himself into his work. And other diversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he meets Michaela, everything changes. Her spitfire assertiveness shines through her somber outer shell &amp;ndash; put there, Gary is certain, by her own parents&amp;#39; recent breakup &amp;ndash; and they forge an unusual friendship, which eventually deepens into love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the course of their courtship, Michaela acquires a terrible secret, which she hides from Gary, for fear of losing him. Over time, a series of revelations &amp;ndash; each more stunning than the one before &amp;ndash; makes Gary re-evaluate everything he was sure he knew. Everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Gary and Michaela salvage the tattered shreds of their relationship? Will her finally divulging the awful secret drive a further wedge between them &amp;ndash; and can their faith enable them to pick up the pieces?&amp;nbsp;Glimpse of Emerald is a tale of love and loss, betrayal and redemption, hope and faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
