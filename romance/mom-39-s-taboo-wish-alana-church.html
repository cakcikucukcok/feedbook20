  <title>Mom&#39;s Taboo Wish - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miranda has been dating losers for years. Her son Brendan can&amp;#39;t get a date at all. But a harmless remark one afternoon changes everything. Now Brendan can&amp;#39;t keep his eyes off his sexy MILF mom. And Miranda feels a sensual tingle when she looks at her son! Can they stay away from temptation? Or has a genie granted &amp;quot;Mom&amp;#39;s Taboo Wish?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;See anything you like?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His head jerked up to find a pair of dark blue eyes looking at him. Not angry, thank God. Curious, maybe? Or perhaps even ever-so-slightly worried? Concerned that her only child would look at her and decide that he could do better?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Quite a bit,&amp;quot; he answered, somehow managing to hold his voice steady. &amp;quot;What there is of it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Her voice held incredulous disbelief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, Mom, I won&amp;#39;t say your legs aren&amp;#39;t lovely. But, you know, they&amp;#39;re just isn&amp;#39;t much of them. It&amp;#39;s not your fault,&amp;quot; he added piously. &amp;quot;I mean, you can&amp;#39;t help it that you&amp;#39;re so short.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hah. You saw a lot more the other night. And you blew your chance.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grinned. &amp;quot;Totally worth it. How many people can say they blew a raspberry on their mother&amp;#39;s stomach?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The ones who are six years old?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re just jealous.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hmph. You haven&amp;#39;t shown me a whole lot to be jealous of, now have you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He met her eyes, ignoring the gibe. &amp;quot;And I got such a short look. Maybe...you wanted me to see you, Mom? All of you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If he hadn&amp;#39;t been watching her reaction, he might have missed the way the tips of her breasts stiffened, pressing against the cloth of her shirt in such a way as to make her arousal undeniably evident. &amp;quot;Just like a boy,&amp;quot; she sniffed, turning her head away, though her breath quickened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not a boy,&amp;quot; he parried. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a man.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh? Prove it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He leaned back, both of her feet in his lap, as his thumbs ran circles around her soles and his fingers massaged the tops, running over the fragile bones. &amp;quot;You show me yours, I show you mine? Pretty kinky, Mom.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Like you haven&amp;#39;t been staring at me like a freshman at the head cheerleader for the past week,&amp;quot; she retorted. Her foot pushed, ever so slightly, into his crotch, as if she was testing him. Hoping to find...what? &amp;quot;All I want is what&amp;#39;s fair.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He paused, letting the moment play out. Then, without saying a word, he moved her feet to the side and unbuttoned his shorts. The sound of the zipper being lowered was very loud in the quiet room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pushed the shorts down his legs, then flicked them to the floor. Miranda wetted her lips with her tongue and stared at his crotch. &amp;quot;The boxers, too,&amp;quot; she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Brendan could see the pulse pounding in his mother&amp;#39;s throat, and the tan expanse of her stomach was sheened with sweat. But he pushed down the waistband of his underwear without a second&amp;#39;s thought.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now you,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her underwear slid down her legs. She cocked her head at him as they hit the floor, her gaze challenging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I want to see it.&amp;quot; The words were a whisper, barely heard. &amp;quot;I want to see you get hard.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He ran a foot up her calf. &amp;quot;That won&amp;#39;t be...difficult.&amp;quot; He smiled, avoiding the obvious pun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well?&amp;quot; Her eyes met his, challenging. &amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t you going to...you know? With your hands?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom.&amp;quot; He shook his head.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t need my hands.&amp;nbsp;All I need is you.&amp;quot;" />
