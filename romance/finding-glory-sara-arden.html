  <title>Finding Glory - Sara Arden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, he was just a hopeless cause from the wrong side of Glory, Kansas. And he&#39;ll be damned if he&#39;ll let anyone drag him back down after finally clawing his way out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that Gina Townsend is a saint, always taking care of everyone around her. And now she&#39;s trying to be a mother to her six-year-old niece, Amanda Jane. But the girl&#39;s biological father isn&#39;t helping matters. The scruffy, gangly boy Gina remembers has returned to Glory a sexy, successful man, but Reed Hollingsworth is the only thing standing between her and losing Amanda Jane to foster care.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Betrayed that neither Townsend sister bothered to tell him he was a father until he had money, Reed&#39;s still not about to shirk his responsibilities. So when he demands Gina move in with him as part of Amanda Jane&#39;s custody agreement, he tries not to notice pretty much everything about her–especially the way his solemn-faced daughter laughs when they play together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raising a child together, Reed and Gina learn that some dreams come and go, but some are a spark that burns eternal…&lt;/p&gt;
