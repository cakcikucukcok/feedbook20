  <title>His Only Wife (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Cathy McDavid</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Everyone Was Sure She Was Gone For Good…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being back in Blue Ridge, Arizona, to help her grandmother was almost a relief after her busy job as a nurse in a Tucson E.R. Aubrey Stuart badly needed a few weeks of peace and quiet–but facing her past was another thing entirely. The boy she&#39;d eloped with and hastily divorced ten years ago had matured. And Gage Raintree the man was a thousand times more tempting than he&#39;d been then.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;…Except Her Ex&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They&#39;d been too young and unsure of each other to fight back when their families decided they&#39;d made a terrible mistake–especially when Gage thought his duty was to devote his life to the family ranch. But now he had six weeks before Aubrey went back to her career.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six weeks to show his first–&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; only–love he deserved a second chance….&lt;/p&gt;
