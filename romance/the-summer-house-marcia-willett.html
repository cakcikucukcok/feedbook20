  <title>The Summer House - Marcia Willett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For years, Marcia Willett has touched readers with her poignant novels about the intricacies of friendship and family. Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Summer House&lt;/i&gt;, she explores the secrets that families keep, and the decisions, made in an instant, that can change our lives.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt has always felt that there was something missing in his life. His mother kept all his childhood memories in a small inlaid wooden box, along with many photos of Matt as a child. But something about these photos has always puzzled Matt. Why doesn&#39;t he remember those clothes? The toys? And where, in the photos, is his sister Imogen? &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Imogen is living with her husband and their baby in a rented cottage. Ever since she was a child, she has loved the Summer House, a charming cottage on the grounds of a beautiful and ancient house in Exmoor. When she has a chance to buy but her husband refuses to move, Imogen begins to question the seemingly picturesque life she has built for herself. Eventually, the Summer House provides the key to the strange and tragic secret which has affected everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
