  <title>The Scarlet Letter followed by Hawthorne - Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;: A Romance is an 1850 work of fiction in a historical setting, written by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. The book is considered to be his &quot;masterwork&quot;. Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, Massachusetts, during the years 1642 to 1649, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity. Throughout the book, Hawthorne explores themes of legalism, sin, and guilt. &quot;Hawthorne&quot; is a book of literary criticism by Henry James published in 1879. The book was an insightful study of James&#39; great predecessor, Nathaniel Hawthorne. James gave extended consideration to each of Hawthorne&#39;s novels and a selection of his short stories. He also reviewed Hawthorne&#39;s life and some of his nonfiction. The book became somewhat controversial for a famous section where James enumerated the items of novelistic interest he thought were absent from American life." />
