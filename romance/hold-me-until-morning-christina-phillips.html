      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled&#39;s Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;She&#39;s the one girl he should never touch...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cooper Grayson is supposed to hole up in a mountain cabin and protect his best friend&#39;s little sister from the paparazzi for a week. That&#39;s it. But Paris O&#39;Connell isn&#39;t a kid anymore, and it&#39;s hard to remember this is &lt;i&gt;strictly business&lt;/i&gt; when she bats her big green eyes at him...then crashes through all his carefully placed boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paris loves a challenge. And gorgeous Cooper Grayson is the most dangerous challenge she&#39;s faced yet. He ignores the sizzling attraction that keeps her awake at nights, and he doesn&#39;t care about her fame or her contacts, only seeing &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. When they finally kiss, Cooper leaves her bare. Exposed. His for the taking. And take he does...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one incredibly hot week, Cooper fulfils her every fantasy. But when the real world crashes in, so does reality. And reality tells them there&#39;s no way a Hollywood star and a bad boy from the wrong side of town could ever have a future together...&lt;/p&gt;" />
