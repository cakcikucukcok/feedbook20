  <title>Vendetta in Death - J. D. Robb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lieutenant Eve Dallas must keep the predator from becoming the prey in&lt;i&gt; Vendetta in Death&lt;/i&gt;, the newest thriller from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J.D. Robb. &lt;/b&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She calls herself Lady Justice. And once she has chosen a man as her target, she turns herself into a tall blonde or a curvaceous redhead, makes herself as alluring and seductive as possible to them. Once they are in her grasp, they are powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first victim is wealthy businessman Nigel McEnroy. His company&#39;s human resources department has already paid out settlements to a couple of his young victims--but they don&#39;t know that his crimes go far beyond workplace harassment. Lady Justice knows. And in one shocking night of brutality, she makes him pay a much steeper price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Eve Dallas and her husband, Roarke, are combing through the evidence of McEnroy&#39;s secret life. His compulsive need to record his misdeeds provides them with a wide range of suspects, but the true identity of Lady Justice remains elusive. It&#39;s a challenging case, made even more difficult by McEnroy&#39;s widow, who reacts to the investigation with fury, denial, and threats. Meanwhile, Lady Justice&#39;s criminal crusade is escalating rapidly, and if Eve can&#39;t stop this vigilante, there&#39;s no telling how much blood may be spilled...&lt;/p&gt;" />
