  <title>Wanting Something More - Kathy Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Wanting What You Get.&lt;/i&gt; Now, meet baby sister Marty, a savvy city girl with a score to settle who&#39;s about to get more than she bargained for.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fate, You Are On My Bad Side&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have got to be kidding me! On a night like this, when most sane people are home to escape a blinding snowstorm, I happen to run into Millbrook&#39;s biggest jerk, Nathaniel Peck, the boy who broke my heart at my junior prom. The one who kissed me on a dare and let his buddies laugh at me. Well, eat dirt, Nathaniel Peck, because you might have noticed me on the covers of a few magazines under the heading: Supermodel. I live in New York City now. I will be leaving as soon as the weather clears. And frankly, if it were a choice between kissing you or braving downed electrical wires, I&#39;d have to think about it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s official: I&#39;ve regressed. It&#39;s just that I can&#39;t stand the Cult of Nathaniel Peck that has come over this town. Okay, so he is Chief of Police. So he did make sure I got home safely. So he didn&#39;t try anything funny with me. So that old smirk has been replaced by a sexy, sad smile.  .  . No. People just do not change that much. Somewhere inside Nate is the same leering, conniving womanizer I remember. And I intend to prove it.  .  ." />
