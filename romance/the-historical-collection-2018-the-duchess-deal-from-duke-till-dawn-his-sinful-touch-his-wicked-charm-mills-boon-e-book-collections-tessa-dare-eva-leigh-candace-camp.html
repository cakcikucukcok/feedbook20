        &lt;h2&gt;Take a step back in time with Mills &amp; Boon’s Historical collection… &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duchess Deal&lt;/em&gt; by Tessa Dare&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the Duke of Ashbury returns from war scarred, he realises he needs an heir – which means he needs a wife! When Emma Gladstone, a vicar&#39;s daughter turned seamstress visits wearing a wedding dress, he decides on the spot that she&#39;ll do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emma is no pushover. She has secrets and some rules of her own. Once she&#39;s seen the man beneath the scars, he can&#39;t stop her from falling in love…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Duke Till Dawn&lt;/em&gt; by Eva Leigh&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Duke of Greyland lost his heart – and a princely sum – to a charming, beautiful and destitute widow who, after one passionate night, vanished without a trace. Cassandra Blair grew up on the city streets, picking pockets to survive. Greyland was a rich mark – to be fleeced and forgotten – only she’d never forgotten him…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Sinful Touch&lt;/em&gt; by Candace Camp&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When an unknown gentleman arrives on his doorstep, Alexander Moreland is astonished to discover that the stranger is a beautiful woman disguised as a man and in great need of his help. The woman remembers nothing except her name, Sabrina, and has only the contents of her pockets as clues to her identity: a handkerchief, a pocket watch, a leather pouch, a torn scrap of paper and a gold ring.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sabrina is certain that she is on the run from someone or something – how else to explain her bruises and the pervasive sense of dread she feels? She’s also certain that she can trust Alex to assist her and is all too aware of the attraction she feels for him. As they race through the streets of Victorian London, Sabrina and Alex must solve the mystery of Sabrina’s past—before whatever she’s running from finds them!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Wicked Charm&lt;/em&gt; by Candace Camp&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lilah Holcutt mistrusts Constantine Moreland from the moment she meets him. He’s frivolous, rash, challenging and, worst of all, a flirt. Constantine knows how Lilah feels about him – he just wishes she wasn’t so gorgeous, that he wasn’t so attracted to her….&lt;/p&gt;
