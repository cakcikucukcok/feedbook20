  <title>Playing Dirty - Susan Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When old enemies are thrown together, all bets are off&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way back in high school, golden boy Cade Gallari publicly revealed he&amp;#39;d slept with &amp;#34;fat girl&amp;#34; Ava Spencer to win a bet. Now a decade older and a head turner with her own concierge business, Ava isn&amp;#39;t the gullible dreamer she once was&amp;#151; and she plans to prove it when Cade, hotter than ever, breezes back into town with an offer she can&amp;#39;t refuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A documentary film producer, Cade is shooting a movie about the mysterious mansion Ava inherited. And he wants &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; as his personal concierge. She&amp;#39;s certainly professional enough to be at his beck and call without giving him everything he wants. Like another shot at having her in his bed. But Ava doesn&amp;#39;t count on Cade&amp;#39;s determination. Because he&amp;#39;s never gotten over her&amp;#151; and he&amp;#39;s not above playing dirty to score a second chance at a red&amp;#150;hot future&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
