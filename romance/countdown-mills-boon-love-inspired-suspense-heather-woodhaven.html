          &lt;strong&gt;BORROWED TIME&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Rachel Cooper witnesses the abduction of her neighbour’s young twin sons, she springs into action to save them. But now the thwarted kidnappers are after her…and her only hope of survival is relying on their widowed single father James McGuire. A weapon has been planted on a satellite James’s company is ready to launch, and as the systems specialist, it’s his job to stop it. But someone is set on keeping James from preventing the scheduled takeoff—and they’ll use anyone close to him as leverage. Now he must find a way to protect his boys and the woman he’s beginning to fall for…before the final countdown can even start.&lt;/p&gt;
