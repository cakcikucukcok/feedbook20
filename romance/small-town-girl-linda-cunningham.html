  <title>Small Town Girl - Linda Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Lauren Smith begrudgingly returns to the small Vermont town where she grew up to arrange for the sale of her late grandmother&#39;s old farmhouse, she has everything she&#39;s always worked for. Lauren drives a Mercedes. She&#39;s engaged to one of the most powerful businessmen in the country and wears a three-carat diamond ring to prove it. She lives in a penthouse on Central Park West. Yes, Lauren has everything she considers important. She is smugly prepared for any eventuality in dealing with these country people so Lauren isn&#39;t surprised when the hot water isn&#39;t working at the old house. No problem. She simply looks in the phone book and calls the local plumber.    The moment Caleb Cochran steps through the old screen door to fix the hot water, the glittery facade that masquerades as Lauren&#39;s life begins to crumble around her. Though she tries hard to deny their mutual, magnetic attraction, Lauren is finally forced to reevaluate her focus and come face-to-face with her true self. Small Town Girl is a story of discovering the true meaning of life and love." />
