  <title>Heirs of a Lost Race - Francis Pitard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;For Polynesians, Tici, Teke, or Tiki is the sacred origin of all knowledge. In the Andes, Kon Tici means &quot;Son of the Sun.&quot; What a remarkable coincidence! Kon Tici had the courage to live with a superb, unshakable ethic of peace. Along his breathtaking journey, he meets a young Polynesian woman, Hina of the Valley. Born with a noble heart, motivated by her tremendous respect for nature, self-reliant, and driven by constant love for her people, she matures quickly, and becomes a priestess second to none. &lt;I&gt;Heirs of a Lost Race&lt;/I&gt; is the love story of Kon Tici and Hina of the Valley that should inspire, give a model of ethics, and provide hope and optimism. They are from different worlds, races, cultures and beliefs, leading to a breathtaking encounter. Within a microcosm of the South Pacific, forgotten values with universal reach are explored. Around the characters there is a constant powerful, spiritual and cosmic presence. The characters feel that presence, which adds a mysterious touch to their story and behavior.&lt;/P&gt;" />
