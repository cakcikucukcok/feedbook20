  <title>LucyO - Robert T. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the 1980s and a suddenly jobless Bob Johnstone leaves London for New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s familiar terrain. Bob settles into his old Gran&amp;rsquo;s bach at Whitecliffs Valley, reviving dusty memories of school holidays as he contemplates what&amp;rsquo;s next for him. But how long can Bob roam the thorny tracks of his youth before the present intrudes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob&amp;rsquo;s quiet retirement quickly goes all sixes and sevens, and he discovers no-one is who they appear to be. His return to Whitecliffs ignites a fuse that inflames hatreds&amp;mdash;and passions&amp;mdash;thought long extinguished. Bob finds the old Dutchman is bitter and vicious as ever, and clever Gran, though many-years dead, haunts Bob&amp;rsquo;s dreams. At the heart of it all is beautiful, red-haired Lucyo, whose reappearance is as mysterious as her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country of Bob&amp;rsquo;s youth becomes a back track of murder and deceit, reaching from 1940s war-torn Holland to 1980s New Zealand, where crime, death, and romance flip Bob, quite literally, battered head over busted heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LucyO&lt;/em&gt; is a crime story laced with humor and romance where regular folk use wits and tenacity to unravel conspiracies and unmask evil. In &lt;em&gt;LucyO&lt;/em&gt;, the men are smart, the women are often smarter, and the South Island is intense and surprising.&lt;/p&gt;" />
