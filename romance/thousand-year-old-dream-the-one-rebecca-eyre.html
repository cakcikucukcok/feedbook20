  <title>Thousand-Year-Old Dream: The One - Rebecca Eyre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emma Ford never does anything crazy. But with five months left to live, Emma changes her perspective, checks off one item on her bucket list, and heads to war-torn Croatia on vacation.  Even though Evon Svacic has a master&#39;s degree, economic circumstances in his native country of Croatia have forced him to take any job just to make a few kunas. When destiny leads Emma to the restaurant where he works as a waiter, Evon cannot ignore their strong physical attraction and invites her to a club later that evening-a decision that leads to an unforgettable night driven by passion and seemingly insatiable desires. After Emma returns home to San Diego, she cannot ignore the raging hunger she has for him.  Thousand-Year-Old Dream weaves seduction with the supernatural world as an American and her Croatian lover attempt to fulfill his ultimate destiny as Jedan, the One." />
