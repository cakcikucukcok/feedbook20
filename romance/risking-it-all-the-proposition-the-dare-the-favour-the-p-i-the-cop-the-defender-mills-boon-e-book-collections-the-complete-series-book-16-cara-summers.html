          &lt;strong&gt;Seduction. Temptation. Desire.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These six sizzling reads from Cara Summer’s will have your heart racing and your bedside lamp burning well into the night!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Proposition &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Agent Chance Mitchell made sexy cop Natalie Gibbs a proposition she couldn&#39;t refuse: all the pleasure she could handle. But only for one night.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The next time Chance saw Natalie, she&#39;d disguised herself as ‘Rachel Cade.’ When the blonde bombshell boldly seduced him, he couldn&#39;t say no. Chance had planned to convince Natalie to help him find a stolen diamond but he asked ‘Rachel’ instead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the case, Chance needed Natalie to pose as ‘Calli,’ a supermodel sexpot. Now he never knew which woman he was in bed with! And, worst of all, he wasn&#39;t willing to give up any of them…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Dare&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Does struggling reporter Rory Gibbs dare to score the first-ever photo of reclusive business tycoon Jared Slade? Little does she know she&#39;ll first have to get past his big, sexy bodyguard, Mark Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hunter promises he&#39;ll get her an interview with his boss on two conditions: she hands over the photos – and gives him one kiss. But one kiss leads to an explosive encounter. And then another. And another!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Favour&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a kiss with a mysterious stranger gets out of control, sensible academic Sierra Gibbs is both frightened and excited by what security specialist Ryder Kane does to her. Ryder’s line of work requires him to be daring and impulsive–exactly what Sierra wants in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when she gets caught in the middle of the dangerous case he&#39;s working on, even the bold new Sierra isn&#39;t sure she can handle a man like Ryder. That is, until Ryder starts calling in some favours of his own…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The P.I.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Private investigator-slash-crime writer Kit Angelis is closing up shop when trouble walks in. But this damsel really is in distress: covered in blood, she&#39;s carrying a wedding dress, a bagful of cash, a recently fired handgun and Kit&#39;s card. And she can&#39;t remember a thing…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly Kit is embroiled in a deadly mystery—and the key is this sultry stranger. She might be a killer. Or she might be totally innocent. All Kit is sure of is that this woman is going to be the hottest thing that ever happened to him…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Cop&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Off-duty detective Nik Angelis is the first on the scene at a wedding gone very, very wrong. The only witness is the caterer, fiery redhead J.C. Riley, who&#39;s eager to make her statement. So eager, in fact, Nik can&#39;t help thinking of other things she could do with her mouth!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;J.C. needs Nik&#39;s protection. But what she wants is his rock-hard body. Nik aims to be professional, but a man can take only so much…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Defender&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Theo Angelis definitely puts the ‘hot’ in ‘hotshot lawyer’. Or at least, that’s lawyer Sadie Oliver’s opinion. If only there was time to explore the chemistry simmering between them…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But there isn’t because Sadie desperately needs Theo’s help. Her brother lies in hospital facing a murder charge, and their sister is missing. Even Sadie herself is being followed by unsavoury-looking characters. Yet Sadie’s not about to take it lying down (unless Theo asks, of course)…&lt;/p&gt;
