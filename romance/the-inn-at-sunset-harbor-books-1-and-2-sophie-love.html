  <title>The Inn at Sunset Harbor (Books 1 and 2) - Sophie Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bundle of books #1 (FOR NOW AND FOREVER) and #2 (FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS) in Sophie Loves&#39;s The Inn at Sunset Harbor series. This bundle offers books #1 and #2 in one convenient file, with over 150,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FOR NOW AND FOREVER, Emily Mitchell, 35, living and working in New York City, has struggled through a string of failed relationships. When her boyfriend of 7 years takes her out for their long-awaited anniversary dinner, Emily is sure that this time will be different, that this time she will finally get the ring. When he gives her a small bottle of perfume instead, Emily knows the time has come to break up with him-and for her entire life to have a fresh start. Reeling from her unsatisfying, high-pressure life, Emily decides she needs a change. She decides on a whim to drive to her father&#39;s abandoned home on the coast of Maine, a sprawling, historic house where she&#39;d spent magical summers as a child. But the house, long-neglected, is in dire need of repair, and the winter is no time to be in Maine. Emily hasn&#39;t been there in 20 years, when a tragic accident changed her sister&#39;s life and shattered her family. Her parents divorced, her father disappeared, and Emily was never able to bring herself to step foot in that house again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS, 35 year old Emily Mitchell has fled her job, apartment and ex-boyfriend in New York City for her father&#39;s abandoned home on the coast of Maine, needing a change in her life. Tapping her life savings to restore the historic home, and with a budding relationship with the caretaker, Daniel, Emily prepares to open the Inn at Sunset Harbor as Memorial Day comes. But all does not go as planned. Emily learns quickly that she has no idea how to run a B&amp;B. The house, despite her efforts, needs new, urgent repairs she cannot afford. Her covetous neighbor is still determined to make trouble for her. And worst of all: just as her relationship with Daniel is blossoming, she learns he has a secret. One which will change everything.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE INN AT SUNSET HARBOR is a dazzling new romance series that will make you laugh, make you cry, will keep you turning pages late into the night-and will make you fall in love with romance all over again.&lt;" />
