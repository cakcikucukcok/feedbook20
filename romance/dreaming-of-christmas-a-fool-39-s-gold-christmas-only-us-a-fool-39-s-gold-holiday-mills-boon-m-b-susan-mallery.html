          &lt;strong&gt;A Fool’s Gold Christmas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cheer in Fool&#39;s Gold, California, is bringing out the humbug in dancer Evie Stryker. An injury has forced her to return home to her estranged family. So she won&#39;t add to the awkward scenario by falling for the charms of her brother&#39;s best friend, no matter how tempting he is. When she&#39;s recruited to stage the winter festival, she vows to do as promised, then move on, anywhere but here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jaded lawyer Dante Jefferson is getting used to the town he now calls home, but the pounding of little dancers&#39; feet above his office is more than he can take. When he confronts their gorgeous teacher, he&#39;s unprepared for their searing attraction. Evie is his best friend&#39;s sister—off-limits unless he&#39;s willing to risk his heart. Dante has always believed that love is dangerous, but that was before he had to reckon with the magic of a certain small town, where miracles do seem to happen….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Only Us: A Fool’s Gold Holiday&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pet groomer Carina Fiore wants nothing more than to confess her feelings to the man she loves. She&#39;s drawn to veterinarian Cameron McKenzie&#39;s good looks, caring nature and especially his devotion to his young daughter. But he&#39;s also her boss and a good friend. Putting her heart on the line could cost Rina both her job and their friendship forever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since his divorce, Cameron hasn&#39;t been willing to trust his heart–or his daughter–with anyone else. For months he&#39;s pushed away all thoughts of taking Rina in his arms and kissing her, unwilling to risk their friendship for a single night of pleasure. But when a kiss under the mistletoe unlocks the simmering…&lt;/p&gt;
