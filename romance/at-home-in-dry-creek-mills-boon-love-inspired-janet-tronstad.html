  <title>At Home in Dry Creek (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Janet Tronstad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;With two kids to raise and her ex-husband in jail, Barbara Strong moved to Dry Creek for a fresh start. She loved the town, but apparently her feelings weren&#39;t reciprocated. Didn&#39;t the folks in Dry Creek trust her?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Truth was, Sheriff Carl Wall had asked everyone to leave Barbara alone so she could heal. The sheriff had vowed to protect the pretty, vulnerable newcomer–from suitors and from any of her ex-husband&#39;s cronies who might try to contact her. But would he be able to do his job if he was in danger of losing his heart?&lt;/p&gt;
