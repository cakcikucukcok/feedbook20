      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maddie is determined to uncover the untold story about the town&#39;s sordid past&amp;#8212;her past. As a child, Maddie lost everything, and now she&#39;s back at the scene of the scandal&amp;#8212;a local establishment that&#39;s always belonged to the Hennessys&amp;#8212;determined to uncover the truth, and nothing is going to stand in her way. Especially not a black-haired, blue-eyed Hennessy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in Truly knows that the Hennessy men are irresistible, and the current owner, Mick, is no exception. His late father was a skirt-chasing heartbreaker who ended up causing disaster for two families. So far, Mick&#39;s managed to keep the ladies in line, but when he claps eyes on Maddie, with her luscious curves and tempting lips, he can&#39;t resist getting tangled up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Maddie is keeping secrets, not the least of which is her true reason for being in town. And when Mick discovers what&amp;#8216;s really going on, there is going to be a whole lot of trouble in Truly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
