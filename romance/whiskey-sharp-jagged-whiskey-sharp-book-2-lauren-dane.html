  <title>Whiskey Sharp: Jagged (Whiskey Sharp, Book 2) - Lauren Dane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The sweetest reward comes after the longest wait.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vicktor Orlov took one look at one look at the wary gaze and slow to trust personality of the deliciously sexy and fascinating Rachel Dolan and knew he wanted more than just a casual friendship. But as a natural protector, he also knew bossiness and overprotective maneuvering would push her away. He’ll use every tool in his easygoing, laidback arsenal to convince her to take a chance on them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel’s flourishing new career as a tattoo artist has brought color back into a life previously damaged by violence. She knows she can trust Vic, it’s herself she’s not sure of. She doesn’t want to be caged or controlled, protected so much she had no ability to make her own choices. And damn if the man doesn’t know it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Vic finally drops all pretenses of “just friends” and focuses all his careful affection and irresistible seduction on her, Rachel knows she’s falling hard for the laid back pretty boy Russian she’d discovered had a relentlessly steel spine when it came to her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And she can’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
