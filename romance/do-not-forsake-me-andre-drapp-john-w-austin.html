  <title>Do Not Forsake Me Andre Drapp - John W. Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John, a young boy growing up in depression-era Arkansas falls in love with his high school sweetheart. They have their lives ahead of them, but a terrible accident occurs, changing them forever. After the boy reaches manhood he seems to be living his dream life but there is one nagging concern that haunts him. John feels an overwhelming desire to tell his grandchildren his story, a story from his past that he knows will affect them all. Meanwhile, a woman who lives in North Carolina with her family has recently lost her husband. Somehow she has always felt connected to the story of young John, and in the end she feels drawn to a place she has never seen: Taos, New Mexico. What happens when she arrives there, and who she finds waiting for her, is both the end and the beginning of a journey of love." />
