  <title>Sweet Stallion (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Stallions, Book 10) - Deborah Fletcher Mello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;They’re not as different as she thinks&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After scoring phenomenal success in Phoenix with her organic food co-op, Naomi Stallion is ready to introduce Vitally Vegan to her Utah town. But meeting her half-siblings and the extended family she never knew isn’t the homecoming she’d hoped for. And now a nasty bidding war over the property Naomi wants to buy puts the unconventional lifestyle coach against sexy, uber-conservative, corporate attorney Patrick O’Brien.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Behind the power suit, ruggedly handsome looks, and dazzling legal maneuvers, Patrick’s a country guy at heart. His attraction to the beautiful farmer who marches to the beat of her own unique drum makes him question his loyalty to the investment conglomerate he represents. The stakes rise when someone close to them both threatens Naomi’s business, forcing Patrick to choose between his career… and the woman he yearns to make his lifelong partner.&lt;/p&gt;
