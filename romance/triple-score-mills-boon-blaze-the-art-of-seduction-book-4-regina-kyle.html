            &lt;strong&gt;Knowing the score…&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prima ballerina Noelle Nelson needs to recover from her injury and return to the stage. She won’t consider failure…or be distracted by baseball&#39;s resident bad boy, Jace Monroe. His tattoos, wicked smile and deliciously athletic body might drive her crazy, but a media frenzy is the last thing this good girl needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jace is sick with fear that his own injury will never heal, but he&#39;s not about to let anyone notice, especially the gorgeous blonde dancer he loves to infuriate. He&#39;s pushing himself past his physical capacity, putting his future at risk. Still, when it comes to making a play for Noelle, Jace is in scoring position—and he’s not going to back down!&lt;/p&gt;
