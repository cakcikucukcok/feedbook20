  <title>The Marriage Portrait (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Pamela Bauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She was as pretty as a picture…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;but that certainly didn&#39;t mean Michael McFerrin would marry her! True, Cassie Carrigan had snared his interest, but she was the linchpin in his lovable-but-meddling mother&#39;s plan to garner a grandchild. The beautiful portrait artist claimed she wasn&#39;t a willing player in this game of marriage-go-round, but her kisses said otherwise. Michael was determined to halt his mother&#39;s antics–and the havoc Cassie caused in his heart. Why, he&#39;d show Cassie who was in control…even if he had to marry her to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Happily Wedded After: Jump headlong into these stories that celebrate saying, &quot;I do!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
