  <title>The Power of Her Passion - Hugh Mortimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Theirs should have been a tabloid editor&#39;s dream. Cassandra Del Ray, the young, incredibly beautiful stripper and nude model with the so called &#39;Reputation&#39; for deceiving her army of would be admirers meets the older, womanising multi millionaire, Brad Farrell; who, although desirable, had achieved a reputation for treating his lovers as disposable toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the reality was so different. Both are single parents, both came from the streets; both were carrying the scars from their past. Cassandra, although born to a drug addicted mother, was fostered by a loving, caring family, only to be kidnapped and horrifically raped when barely a teenager, then compelled to abandon everyone she loved in the belief that her psychopathic abductor would kill them. Brad, too, originally from the same streets, had used his sporting talents to rise above his origins, yet used women as a means of easing the pain of his wife&#39;s sudden, tragic death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
