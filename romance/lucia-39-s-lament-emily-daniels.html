  <title>Lucia&#39;s Lament - Emily Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Mama, Miss Nightingale needs me,&amp;rdquo; Lucia insists, determined to go to Crimea to help Florence Nightingale nurse wounded soldiers. Since she was a little girl, wounded creatures have brought out her compassionate side, but there is more waiting for her in Crimea than nursing&amp;hellip; and Miss Nightingale will certainly not approve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ronald has given up on love. At least, loving people. People always go away and leave a big hole in your heart. It&amp;rsquo;s better not to love at all. Horses, however, are a different matter. They are steady and strong and always love you, no matter what. That&amp;rsquo;s why he joined the Scots Greys, after all. He has it all figured out... until he meets a certain spunky nurse in a Scutari hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;1854, Crimea. The Battle of Balaclava and the Charge of the Light Brigade. This historical setting creates an exciting backdrop for richly fascinating history and the passion of unexpected romance. How far will Lucia and Ronald go to pursue the forbidden love blossoming in their hearts?&lt;/p&gt;" />
