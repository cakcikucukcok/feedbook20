  <title>Christine Mccall - Helen Hendricks Friess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christine McCall left home at age 17. She was newly married to a man who wanted to become famous. When her marriage failed she returned home to learn her parents and young brother were possibly killed in an auto accident. She is unable to confirm any facts. She is alone in the world. She begins a new life but makes many serious mistakes along the way which result in tragic circumstances for her. She decides to change her life. Five years later she marries George McCall, a wealthy business man, who in spite of her past loved her deeply. She keeps a happy face but the ghosts of her past continue to haunt and shame her. They have twenty-five happy years together before his death. After five years of mourning for him she finally decides she needs to build a new life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When a young man appears on her doorstep, claiming to be the son of her dead brother, she is shocked and shaken, but also hopeful that she now has a new family with this young man, his very young wife, and baby daughter. A new found friend and her attorney are concerned about the visitors and help her to find answers about her past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
