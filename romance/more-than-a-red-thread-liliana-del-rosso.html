      <meta name="description" content="Two sisters, in disagreement over love, try to overcome a thorny relationships. When they think that their wounds are beginning to heal, destiny returns, relentlessly, to charge what it&#39;s due.&lt;br/&gt;
Raquel, unable to forgive, becomes a bitter, monotonous and controlling woman. Alaya, isolated from her family, takes an obsessive refuge in her job. Erick, the man that split them, a journalist addicted to adrenaline, always after sensationalist and dangerous stories. Unsatisfied with his work on the Afghan War, decides to infiltrate the world of Colombian drug trafficking. A life of excesses made him fall in a bottomless pit, dragging everyone around him along.&lt;br/&gt;
Three people whose lives form up a painful story, after eight years, come together again to meet for reasons very different to love. When it all seemed forgotten, pride and love will be put again on a scale. Destiny will force them to put behind the pain and resentment that split them one day.&lt;br/&gt;
