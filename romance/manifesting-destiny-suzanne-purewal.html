      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sara Taylor&amp;rsquo;s world is turned upside down again. While searching for clarity on a self-imposed sabbatical, Sara meets a handsome stranger, Phil Potter. He offers her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for adventure. With nothing left to lose, Sara jumps at the chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through patience and perseverance, Phil tears down the walls Sara has built up. And with his guidance, she has an epiphany about her true calling and how she will make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara realizes she must tie up loose ends, particularly with former lover, Joe Lazaro, before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Lazaro desperately clings to hope of repairing his relationship with Sara. He will do anything to regain her love and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is unexpected turmoil concerning the Lazaro family that puts all of their lives in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the course of events compel Sara to return to her former life? Or will she ultimately choose the newly inspired path to pursue and achieve her dreams?&lt;/p&gt;" />
