Not even when he is finally free. Only one person brings some light into his life full of self-hatred and guilt. His psychiatrist Holly Westham. She awakens conflicting feelings in him.

Holly doesn&amp;#39;t feel deterred by Player&amp;#39;s dark past. She sees the deeply wounded soul behind the mask. But in order to help the man who has awoken something in her, she has to put herself in danger. Will she be able to save him or has she taken on more than she can handle?&lt;br /&gt;
