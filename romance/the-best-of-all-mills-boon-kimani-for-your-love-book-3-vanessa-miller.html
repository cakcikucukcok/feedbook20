  <title>The Best of All (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (For Your Love, Book 3) - Vanessa Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Surry McDaniel loves designing beautiful clothes. In fact, it&#39;s the only thing she truly loves.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clothes can never fail her, the way people can. But when she&#39;s accused of stealing designs, Surry risks losing the life she&#39;s spent years building. The only person who can help is Ian Duncan, a political strategist who knows how to fix bad PR and who hasn&#39;t been able to stop thinking about Surry since they met. But Surry has kept him – and everyone else – at arms&#39; length as long as they&#39;ve known each other. Helping her would be a risk, but the more Ian gets to know Surry, the more he knows that while she needs him, he needs her even more.&lt;/p&gt;
