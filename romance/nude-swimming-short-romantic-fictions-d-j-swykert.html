  <title>Nude Swimming: Short Romantic Fictions - D.J. Swykert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nude swimming is a collection of stories about love and romance in the lives of an eclectic group of individuals. From physicist Jack Joseph, caught in the space between his love for the beautiful Marilee and his famous General Theory of Non-Existence, to the manic Loonsfoot and his possessive love for Esther who has left him to be with a woman. These short romantic fictions explore relationships from the extreme peripheral to the&amp;nbsp; intimate inside of affairs of the heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The single thread that binds the stories&amp;nbsp;together is our need for love, compassion and companionship in spite of our variances in&amp;nbsp;ideas and ethics that separate us. I want the reader to experience why a young Maggie Harrington, on the eve of her wedding to one man, surrenders her virginity to another. Or what propels a self assured Rosemary to&amp;nbsp;request her lover to &amp;nbsp;dominate her in a spanking episode. I am hoping, within the framework of these not so ordinary characters, to connect you as a reader to the not so ordinary conflicts that exist in&amp;nbsp;your own&amp;nbsp;relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
