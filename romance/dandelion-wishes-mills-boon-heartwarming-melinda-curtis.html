  <title>Dandelion Wishes (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) - Melinda Curtis</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Will Jackson was a control freak and a killjoy.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He had been since they were kids. He’d made it his mission to come between Emma Willoughby and her best friend—his little sister—all their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until the day of the accident Emma had always thought of herself as adventurous, not dangerous…. And then her friend had almost died.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She desperately needed to apologize, to try to explain, if she could.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Will had managed to keep the two apart while Tracy was in the hospital, but now that she was home in Harmony Valley, the winemaker-wannabe had to understand that getting past this was the only way they could heal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And yet even if Tracy was able to, Emma wasn’t sure she could forgive herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Will had made it abundantly clear: he wouldn’t sleep until he’d found retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
