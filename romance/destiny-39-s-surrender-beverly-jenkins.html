  <title>Destiny&#39;s Surrender - Beverly Jenkins</title>

But searching for a bride isn&amp;#39;t as simple as he&amp;#39;d hoped, and many of the respectable women of his acquaintance feel . . . lacking. Then beautiful, feisty Wilhelmina &amp;#34;Billie&amp;#34; Wells arrives at the family ranch with a toddler in her arms, claiming Drew is the father!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The woman he didn&amp;#39;t know he loved . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billie had no choice but to show up at Destiny in search of Drew. For the sake of their child, she&amp;#39;s willing to leave him with his father so the boy can have a better life, but then, before she can blink, she&amp;#39;s saying &amp;#34;I do&amp;#34; in front of a preacher in a marriage of convenience. All Billie and Drew have in common is the heat that brought them together, but can their sizzling passion lead to an everlasting love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
