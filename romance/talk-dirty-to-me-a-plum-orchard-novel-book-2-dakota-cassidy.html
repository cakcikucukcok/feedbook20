      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Former mean girl Dixie Davis is back in town and it&#39;s payback time. Literally. Dixie is flat broke and her best–make that only–friend, Landon, is throwing her a lifeline from the Great Beyond. Dixie stands to inherit his business…&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; she meets a few conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;s got to live in Landon&#39;s mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her gorgeous ex-fiancé, Caine Donovan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Who could also inherit the business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Which is a phone sex empire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wait, &lt;em&gt;what? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Landon&#39;s will lays it out: whoever gets the most new clients becomes the owner of Call Girls. Dixie has always been in it to win it, especially when it comes to Caine, who&#39;s made it clear he&#39;s not going down easy. (Oh, mercy.) Can Dixie really talk dirty &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; prove that she&#39;s cleaned up her act? Game on!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Plum Orchard, Georgia, is about to get even juicier…&lt;/p&gt;
