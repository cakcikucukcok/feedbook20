      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;TO HELP KEEP YOUR EREADER TOPPED UP, ALL TITLES IN THE SERIES ARE ON LOCKDOWN DURING CORONAVIRUS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A sexy aristocrat. A wild-child inner city cop. A crime wave of passion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Feisty London street cop Shannon Aguerri walks a dangerous line between her methods and justice. After one-too-many maverick missions the bosses lose their nerve. When she&amp;#39;s moved out from the city she rapidly discovers there&amp;#39;s way more going on in the sleepy country village than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The son of a local aristocrat arouses suspicion of drug crime activity... but his widower father arouses more animal instincts! &amp;nbsp;As a loner Shannon has attracted men but nothing has stuck. When she meets Spencer, the hunky Earl of Bloxington, there is an immediate rapport between them. &amp;nbsp;Already in the mix however, is an upper class rival who has long plotted her way into the Earl&amp;#39;s bed. The jealousy is an evil shade of green and the anger is a violent scarlet. Will she stoop to blackmail to thwart Shannon and Spencer&amp;#39;s romance?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a body is found in a ditch, life in the village turns sinister. Shannon has a hunch. Her instincts point to a local family. She needs conclusive proof and is determined to get it whatever the cost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will Shannon risk her heart and career on yet another high risk unauthorised investigation? Can she get justice for an innocent boy? Dare a kid from the gutter dream of being a countess?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;#39;Dynasty&amp;#39; is the second in Emma Calin&amp;#39;s kick-ass female cop &amp;#39;Passion Patrol Series&amp;#39;, combining thrilling crime mystery with suspense romance. &amp;nbsp;If you enjoy James Patterson, Nora Roberts, Catherine Coulter and Kendra Elliot, &amp;nbsp;you&amp;#39;ll love a series that combines all of their best traits in fast-paced, pulse-pounding roller-coaster adventures full of passionate steamy romance, danger, love and... hot tea... yes really!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
