        &lt;h2&gt;Four sizzlingly sexy romances from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wed for His Secret Heir&lt;/em&gt; by Chantelle Shaw&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From one-night mistress…To pregnant bride!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a new acquisition at stake, Giannis Gekas must shake his playboy reputation. Enlisting beautiful Ava Sheridan to pose as his fiancée should be the key. Yet behind closed doors, their attraction is anything but fake! But Giannis is furious when he learns Ava is keeping the consequences of their passion a secret. Now to legitimise his child, Giannis has only one option—make Ava his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tycoon&#39;s Ring of Convenience&lt;/em&gt; by Julia James&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;It was purely convenient……until their scorching wedding night!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When self-made billionaire Nikos meets socialite Diana, he’s instantly intrigued by her ice-cool façade. Her determination to save her family home provides Nikos with the perfect opportunity to propose a temporary marriage. But during their honeymoon, Nikos awakens Diana’s simmering desire and the heat between them blazes into overwhelming passion! Now Nikos can’t deny he craves more from his not-so-convenient wife…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Cinderella for the Desert King&lt;/em&gt; by Kim Lawrence&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Saved by a vow…Crowned as his queen!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To escape desert bandits, Abby Foster pledged herself to a mysterious stranger—sealing the deal with a searing kiss! Months later, she discovers she’s still married. And her ‘husband’, who is now heir to the throne, summons her to his side! But being swept into Zain’s world of glamour—and exquisite pleasure—is overwhelming for shy Abby. Can this innocent Cinderella ever become this powerful Sheikh’s queen?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bound by the Billionaire&#39;s Vows&lt;/em&gt; by Clare Connelly&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;‘I have a condition…’Can she agree to her husband’s terms?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When heiress Skye learns her marriage to Matteo was built on lies, she demands a divorce. A pawn in his revenge, Skye’s heart shattered when she discovered her husband’s game. The clock is ticking; she needs his signature. But Matteo is not willing to let Skye go so easily—the price of her freedom is one last night together!&lt;/p&gt;
