To prove to her overbearing&amp;nbsp;father she can flip a house on her own, she takes on an ambitious project&amp;nbsp;that brings back painful memories&amp;mdash;and puts her in the path of the most&amp;nbsp;alluring man she&amp;#39;s ever met. Enza plans to flip the house she inherited from&amp;nbsp;her estranged grandmother in Bayou Sabine, Louisiana. As a child, she spent&amp;nbsp;summers there until the day her mother inexplicably left. Since then, Enza&amp;nbsp;hasn&amp;#39;t let anyone get close to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Bayou Sabine, Enza finds her house occupied by bedeviling&amp;nbsp;firefighter Jack Mayronne. Enza wants to kick him out, but Jack convinces&amp;nbsp;her to let him stay in exchange for helping with repairs. With only six weeks to&amp;nbsp;fix the house and sell, she&amp;#39;s determined to prove her father wrong&amp;mdash;but she&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#39;t count on Bayou Sabine and Jack capturing her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Enza&amp;#39;s fling with Jack intensifies, she finds herself entangled with a&amp;nbsp;vengeful arsonist from Jack&amp;#39;s past. As she reaches her breaking point, she&amp;nbsp;must decide: Should she sell the house and leave her past behind for good,&amp;nbsp;or can she overcome her fears and build a new life there with Jack?&lt;/p&gt;" />
