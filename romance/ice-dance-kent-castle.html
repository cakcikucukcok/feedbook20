  <title>Ice Dance - Kent Castle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A woman with an obsession, a man with a weakness, a girl with a dream. This contemporary romance novel series develops around a mother/daughter/young man romantic triangle. The story traces the figure skating career of a Houston pairs team from their rocky startup, working  their way up the competition ladder all the way to the Olympics. It depicts the effort and sacrifice that go into, and the agony and ecstasy that emerge from top-level figure skating competition. It contrasts the lifestyle and attitudes of a wealthy family with those of a young middle-class bachelor working his way through graduate school. The quest for a gold medal requires dedication, sacrifice, and resiliance. It is complicated by teenage pique, unspoken desires, emotional demands, and unfair competition.
This first book in the series covers the rocky startup and early development of the pairs skating team. Accurate in its treatment of the sport of figure skating, it shows what determined competitors must be willing to do to survive the competition, both on and off the ice.
&quot;Passions flare both on and off the ice.&quot;
&quot;An enjoyable romance on ice. A consistently entertaining work of steamy fun.&quot;
&quot;Readers who enjoy a fun, light romance will get everything they hope for.&quot;
&quot;The well-written skating scenes are precise and accurate.
Castle knows his way around a rink.&quot; - Kirkus review.
&quot;Titillating melodrama takes to the ice rink in this story of ambition and exploitation with
a vividly portrayed setting.&quot;
&quot;Kent Castles well-researched novel explores more than the petty fights that fill
the air with tension. Castle relies on his extensive knowledge of figure skating to create a glitzy, exciting setting.&quot;
&quot;Seduction mingles with humor in riveting scenes between Dean Steele, the experienced skater, and Millie, the mother of the aspiring young skater. They interact, adding a sexual charge by getting physical with each other. Their relationship is titillating&quot;
&quot;This down-and-dirty view of competitive ice skating edges into a shock-worthy presentation that ranks high in entertainment value. It is likely an enjoyable tale for fans of this popular sport.&quot; - Clarion review.
&quot;The pace is fast and keeps the reader engaged. The plot is logical.&quot;
&quot;This is an adult book with explicit sexual content.&quot; - Blueink review." />
