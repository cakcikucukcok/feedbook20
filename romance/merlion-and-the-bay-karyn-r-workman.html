  <title>Merlion and the Bay - Karyn R. Workman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Laramie Holden is a fighter. Despite tragic events in her past, she claws her way up the corporate ladder to become the youngest female partner at a San Francisco law firm. A self-professed workaholic, Laramie lands in Singapore to facilitate a business deal for a new luxury hotel, but first she is mandated to take a much needed vacation. With the demands of her career, Laramie never seems to find the time to datebut that is all about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just four years, Akihiro Amori has created a tremendously successful hotel and spa that has become the standard in Singapore and Southeast Asia. He has never been distracted from his professional goalsthat is, until Laramie Holden checks into his hotel. Mesmerized by her natural beauty, Akihiro asks Laramie out on a date and ignites a passionate romance. But when Laramie discovers Akihiro is hiding a secret, the trust she once shared with him is destroyed. As she leaves Singapore with nothing but a suitcase and a broken heart, Akihiro wills himself to forget her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a vast ocean dividing them, only time will tell if the love Laramie and Akihiro created in just thirteen days will triumph over shattered promises.&lt;/p&gt;" />
