  <title>Weddings, Crushes, and Other Dramas - Emily McKay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Falling in love with the best man wasn&#39;t on the program. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willa is happy to be the maid of honor in her dad&#39;s upcoming wedding to uber-celeb Mia McCain. Not as happy about the best man being her soon-to-be stepbrother, the infuriating--and infuriatingly gorgeous--Finn McCain. Every time their paths cross, the attraction simmering between them grows a little harder to ignore. Willa knows all about guys like Finn--they only want what they can&#39;t have. What&#39;s between them isn&#39;t real. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finn has never felt anything more real than what&#39;s developing between him and Willa. Sure, her dad warned him to steer clear, but it&#39;s not just about forbidden temptation. He&#39;s determined to prove to Willa he&#39;s not going anywhere--and that happily-ever-after will always be worth the risk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains a wedding so crazy it&#39;ll make you laugh, a stepbrother so hot he&#39;ll make you swoon, and a heroine so real she&#39;ll make you cry.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Willa and Finn duology is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Series Order: &lt;br&gt;#1: How Willa Got Her Groove Back&lt;br&gt;#2: Weddings, Crushes, and Other Dramas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Willa and Finn duology is part of the larger, multi-authored Creative HeArts Series, which can be read out of order.
