  <title>Texas Heat: Lone Star Intrigue #1 - Debra White Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman is wrongly accused&amp;#8212;and one man will risk everything to prove her innocence and save her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing Jack Mansfield ever wanted was to arrest his former sweetheart&amp;#8212;especially with her crying five-year-old hanging on to her. But Jack is the police chief of Bullard, Texas, and  records indicate Charli has embezzled more than $100,000 from the bank where she works. Charli swears she&#39;s innocent, but Jack must abide by the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charli thought she had pieced her life back together after her first husband left her alone and pregnant. But now she sits in a jail cell, accused of a crime she did not commit, with a little girl waiting on the outside. Charli&#39;s faith has always kept her steady during the ups and downs of life, but she can&#39;t deny she&#39;s now close to despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack has harbored unrequited love for Charli for over a decade; and that love drives him to task himself and his private-eye brother, Sonny, to prove her innocence and find the perpetrator. But Jack and Charli will never have their happily-ever-after if she goes to prison...or is murdered by the person who framed her. Will they find the true culprit in time to save Charli&#39;s life and finally give their love a chance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes discussion questions, a letter from the author, and a preview of book two in the Lone Star Intrigue series&lt;/p&gt;" />
