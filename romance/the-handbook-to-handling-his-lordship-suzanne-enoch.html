  <title>The Handbook to Handling His Lordship - Suzanne Enoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HANDBOOK TO HANDLING HIS LORDSHIP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;SUZANNE ENOCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Portsman has a secret, and three years ago she decided the best way to keep it would be to work at the Tantalus Club, a notorious gaming establishment for gentlemen. It&#39;s not the sort of work a beautiful, well-bred governess would ever consider-unless she&#39;s hiding from her past and a man who wants to destroy her present... &lt;br&gt;Nate Stokes, Earl of Westfall, is a supremely accomplished former spy more at home on London&#39;s seedy streets than in any glittery ballroom. His peers know him only as a bookish fellow who can find anything-or anyone. When the Marquis of Ebberling hires him to find a murderess, Nate&#39;s search leads him to the Tantalus Club and Emily Portsman. In a game where no one is who they seem and when every conversation is a deadly dance of trust and desire, the only thing Nate knows for sure is that once he gets Emily in his arms, he will never let go...&lt;/p&gt;" />
