We share a house, our friends, a life. She knows all my secrets . . . except one. My desperate need for her is inked on my body, it&#39;s the best I can do. But Hadley needs to hear the words . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Growing up as foster kids, Hadley made me feel whole-sane. And what did I do? I destroyed our chance to be together. I ran out on Hadley when I should have stayed, and something broke between us. Now I&#39;ll do anything to fix it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I&#39;ll never leave her again. I won&#39;t &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; let her feel afraid again. But the more I try to protect her from my pain, the more I just make things worse. I&#39;m terrified that if I tell her everything, she&#39;ll never forgive me. I&#39;m even more terrified that it may be too late to make her mine. I have to try to give her what she needs . . . it&#39;s a debt I&#39;m determined to repay." />
