  <title>The Purple Lady... - Jitesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Purple Lady is the story of the girl who is vividly narcissist, a struggler and of course someone who had promised life that she would not be enjoying it at a constant pace. The best part of her story is that random incidences are a part and parcel of her life. Unlike the Ravana of yore, who possessed the elixir of life in his belly, she possessed the figurative gem of eternal conflict in hers. 
Amid the tragedies of life and the sadness that kept her tripping almost everywhere, she meets a person who promises to take away all her worries and was ready to share her all her pains for rest of the life. 
The story started with trust, they become friends and finally in love. And they became victims of this infection. Problems, they kept coming in different intervals keeping pace with her journey of life. For example  she gets diagnosed with a cancerous cyst in her ovaries and these would not allow her to conceive. This is just to name one, and the person who came into her life ignored along with other more ailments. The story holds a lot of incidents that burnish the trust the duo had in each other, and it also reveals the pain that broke apart the budding relationship and finally tore it asunder. 
So, a stereotypical Brahmin youth from Bihar named Kanisk falls for a beautiful Sikh girl. Or was it the otherwise, girl catching the wrong end of the callow Bihari youth, Kanisk. The discussions and decisions, challenges and the love trials, everything will just remind of love, sniffles and rejuvenation. Carry on! 
You are most open to God, when your heart is wide open, and your mind is settled and worry-free. For most of us, this happens in the presence of our beloved --- Anonymous" />
