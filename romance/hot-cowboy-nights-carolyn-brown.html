  <title>Hot Cowboy Nights - Carolyn Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;If you like cowboy romances, you can never go wrong with a Carolyn Brown book.&quot; -Romancing the Book Blog&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;If gossip is the lifeblood of a small town, then Lizzy Logan has been its beating heart. After being dumped by her fiance for another woman, she could have decided to crawl under a rock. But no, she&#39;d rather really set tongues wagging by &quot;moving on&quot; with one of the hottest cowboys in Texas, who happens to live next door at the Lucky Penny Ranch. Those busybodies don&#39;t have to know it&#39;s actually all pretend. And just because Lizzy has no aim to tame her wild, blue-eyed neighbor doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t enjoy the ride of her life.&lt;br&gt;  Toby Dawson never was and never will be the settling-down type. But what harm could there be in agreeing to be Lizzy&#39;s pretend boyfriend? They&#39;ll put on a show for a few weeks and be done. Yet the more he gets to know Lizzy-really know her-the harder it is for him to keep his hands off of her in private. Soon this rough-and-ready cowboy is hoping to heal Lizzy&#39;s bruised heart and turn their fake affair into a true romance . . .&lt;br&gt;" />
