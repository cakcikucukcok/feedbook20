  <title>The Viscount&#39;s Wicked Ways - Anne Mallory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He has a way with women . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Ashe, the brooding Viscount Blackfield, is a man any lady would shun. But Patience Harrington, try as she might, has never been a proper lady. Her bumbled London season left her with no marital prospects and no recourse but to accept her father&#39;s invitation to travel to gloomy Blackfield Castle. Surely, spending a few nights in the presence of priceless antiques and a devilish viscount can&#39;t be as bad as facing the ton gossip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused solely on his secret government project, Thomas cares little for the valuable antiques he&#39;s recently inherited. The troublesome young woman who has come to assess them, however, stirs his senses in every way. Patience is a distraction Thomas can ill afford&amp;#8212;a beautiful temptation that makes him ache with desire. For a spy is threatening to destroy all he has built, and Patience is hiding something. With so much at stake, Thomas must do whatever it takes to seduce the truth from Patience&#39;s lips before lives&amp;#8212;and his own heart&amp;#8212;are lost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
