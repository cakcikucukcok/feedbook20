  <title>Christian Marriage Companion - Dr. Sunny Uwadiae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christian Marriage Companion is one of the most comprehensive and
authoritative books on the biblical model of marriage and family. It is a
blueprint on what an ideal Christian marriage is and how to achieve it. It
exhaustively explains the ordinance and covenant of marriage, its central
and peripheral purposes, role relationships of man and wife, how to push
beyond intimacy into marital unity, hindrances to a happy marriage, how
to resolve confl icts, and how to achieve a blissful Christian marriage. It
fully examines issues such as same-sex marriage, oral sex, use of sex toys,
pornography, masturbation, divorce, remarriage, effective communication,
forgiveness, adultery, and active listening.
With over 300 Bible references and real-life examples from marital
counselling sessions, the book covers virtually all the knowledge and skills
for making a Christian marriage a true success. It is a manual covering all
that a person needs to know to bring full healing to their marriage, making
the book a veritable alternative to face-to-face counselling. It reveals striking
truths about Christian marriage that will be extremely hard to fi nd elsewhere.
These include an in-depth analysis of the marriage proclamation, the idea
that emotional and spiritual education is the central purpose of marriage,
the idea of spiritual divorce, and the idea that Christian marriages aim at
a deeper-than-intimate relationship. Christian Marriage Companion is the
kind of book you simply place on the shelf for your spouse to read in their
own time. They will fi nd it absolutely compelling to read. As they do so,
only the stone-hearted will resist being reformed by it.
Newlywed couples and those looking to improve their marriage would
fi nd this book most useful. Although it was written specifi cally for Christian
couples of all denominations, it has great potentials for positively impacting
the marriages of non-Christians who read it with open minds. The Christian
marriage ideals it teaches are unsurpassable and altruistic." />
