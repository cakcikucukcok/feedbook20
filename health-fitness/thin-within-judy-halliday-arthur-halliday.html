  <title>Thin Within - Judy Halliday, Arthur Halliday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I want to lose weight, but dieting just doesn&#39;t seem to work.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;I&#39;ve tried everything, and I&#39;m still three sizes too big.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Help! I hate the way my body looks.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Sound familiar? Like many women and men, perhaps you have tried virtually every wtight-loss plan that exists only to give up in disappointment and despair. Have you faithfully counted fat grams and calories? Have you subjected yourself, week after week, to the humiliation of hearing what your current weight should be compared to what it is? Have you exercised excessively, given up your favorite foods, and felt guilty when you&#39;ve failed to meet your weight goals?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Time tested for more than 30 years, &lt;I&gt;Thin Within&lt;/I&gt; is the original hunger-fullness plan. Tens of thousands of participants in the program have joyfully reported the release of unwanted weight. More importantly, they have maintained that weight with a new and incomparable peace with themselves and with the One who designed them. &lt;I&gt;Thin Within&lt;/I&gt; makes it possible to:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Identify and resolve issues that cause you to eat more than your body needs&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Leave diets behind forever&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Discover and enjoy those foods that promote health and vitality&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Experience the abundant life as you reach and maintain your natural God-given size&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;" />
