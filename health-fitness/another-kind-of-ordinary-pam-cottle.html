  <title>Another Kind of Ordinary - Pam Cottle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a secondary school teacher expecting my third child, I thought I knew what to expect from motherhood and how to deal with most situations. However, I was totally unprepared for what followed as I embarked on a course where past experience was irrelevant and no systems were effective. These are the events that followed and my reflections on my new life. It is my story but it is also the story of many mothers living with similar challenges - some of whom you will meet in your daily lives. There are no answers yet, only increasing understanding that comes through shared experience. This book tells my story from pregnancy to the approach of Ben’s eighteenth birthday. It is divided into five parts: a series of (roughly chronological) anecdotes for parts one to three; my personal reflections on different issues in part four and a look to the future in part five." />
