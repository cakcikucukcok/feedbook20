  <title>The Tingling: My Story of a Living Form - Alexandra Porter, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No man can exist without a maker. In the physical world, we attribute that title to our mother and father. They are the ones we call our parentsour makers. During our early years, it is these people whom we consciously recognize as our first treasures. Then, there comes a time when we begin to grow up and start to look deeper into the subject. As you follow the trail in this book that has been prepared for the reader, I hope that you can find some treasures along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is my concept of an invisible, formless substance that has become my constant companion. The Tingling is my storythe story of a woman who is in tune with an invisible, formless substance whose idyllic visions are its form of communication. The unique concepts in this book are novel and unexplored areas of healing, which have been in my practice for many years. I wanted to share my visions with you in hope that they would show you a different point of view. I will share with you several meaningful life experiences to best illustrate the methods of communication I maintained with an invisible force I call the Tingling. I hope the framework and patterns of this book enhance your perspective view of the life you are leading.&lt;/p&gt;
