  <title>The With or Without Meat Cookbook: The Flexible Approach to Flavorful Diabetes Cooking - Jackie Newgent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the growing evidence that vegetarian meals are great for your health, more people with diabetes are looking to build vegetarian dishes into their meal plans. However, not everyone is ready to give up meat completely, and most vegetarians live with someone who&#39;s not ready to take the plunge. Thus was born the &quot;flexitarian,&quot; someone who eats mainly vegetarian food, but occasionally fits in a little meat, poultry, or fish. Catering to this growing crowd &amp;#8212; nearly one in four Americans self-identifies as a flexitarian &amp;#8212; &lt;I&gt;The With or Without Meat Cookbook&lt;/I&gt; makes it simple for people to savor the tastes and health benefits of eating more like a vegetarian, while being able to stick to a balanced meal plan for diabetes. Each of the 125 diabetes-friendly recipes is vegetarian with a non-vegetarian recipe &amp;#8220;add-on&amp;#8221; provided as well. Each recipe can be made two ways: One way for veggie lovers and one way for meat lovers. For those with diabetes, pre-diabetes, heart health issues, or simply looking to improve their diet, the flexitarian approach provides the best of both worlds. Nutrition facts are provided and each perfectly-portioned recipe follows ADA&#39;s nutritional guidelines." />
