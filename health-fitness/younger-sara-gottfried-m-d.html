  <title>Younger - Sara Gottfried, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Hormone Cure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hormone Reset Diet&lt;/em&gt; shows every woman how to create a lifestyle that will help her look great, feel energized, and slow down the effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel destined for cellulite, saddle bags, and belly fat? Does your family come from a long line of Alzheimer&#39;s, cancer, or heart disease? Will nothing help your aging skin or declining libido or flagging energy? This book is for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body is magnificent but it doesn&#39;t come with a lifetime warranty, or an operating manual. You&#39;re the result of millions of years of evolution, but many of the adaptations that helped your ancestors survive are now working overtime to accelerate the aging process. The assumption here is that we are our genes and therefore trapped by the past. The good news is that your genetic code&amp;#8212;the DNA sequence that is the biochemical basis of heredity&amp;#8212;can play a minor role in the way you age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific reality is that 90 percent of the signs of aging and disease are caused by lifestyle choices, not your genes. In other words, you have the capability to overcome and transform your genetic history and tendencies. Harvard/MIT&amp;#8212;trained physician Sara Gottfried, M.D. has created a revolutionary 7-week program that empowers us to make the critical choices necessary to not just look young, but also feel young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gottfried identifies and builds this book around the five-key factors that lead to accelerated aging -the muscle factor, the brain factor, the hormone factor, the gut factor, and the toxic fat factor. The 7-week program addresses these factors and treats them in an accessible and highly practical protocol and is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feed&amp;#8212;Week 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep&amp;#8212;Week 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move&amp;#8212;Week 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Release&amp;#8212;Week 4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose&amp;#8212;Week 5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soothe&amp;#8212;Week 6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think&amp;#8212;Week 7&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Younger&lt;/em&gt; increases not only your lifespan, but also your healthspan. Dr. Gottfried&#39;s program makes it possible to change the way you age, stay younger longer, and remain healthy and vibrant for all of your days.&lt;/p&gt;" />
