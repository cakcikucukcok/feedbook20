  <title>Mountain-Moving Meditations - Rochelle Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mountain, Moving Meditations reminds us that God has preordained our present and future.  Our responsibility is to allow His plans to be made manifest in our lives.  These affirmations are like a warm cup of hot chocolate on a cold winters day. They warm your heart and remind you of WHO you are in Christ Jesus.
Commissioner Veronda L. Durden
The book was good! Great way to inspire others to love God more and trust the gift he put in us by reading, believing and having corresponding action. Failure is not final I love it! Means to me Gods word is final!

Lady Rochelle Owens reminds us that life is a journey. In this easy read and practical book of meditations, she shares helpful Biblical insights that strengthen our spiritual resolve in conquering  the mountains in our personal journey of life. Refer to it often for a safe and successful trip. May God grant you much success in your contributions to the Kingdom of God.
Bishop Robert L. Evans
Senior Pastor of Bethel Temple of Longview, Inc in Longview, Texas
In her new devotional, Rochelle Owens has taken thirty seven mountain moving scriptures and gleaned life lessons, inspiration and challenges for our daily living.  She reminds us that life rolls through stormy and calm seasons, and that it is during the calm seasons that we must fortify ourselves for the next storm.  Her basic message throughout these daily meditations is to trust God, ask for and expect responses, and act upon those responses. Her daily challenges provide positive methods for insuring Christian growth and abundant living.
