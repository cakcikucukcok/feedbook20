  <title>A Doctor&#39;s Guide to Herbs and Supplements - Dr. Robert M.D. DiPaola, Timothy Gower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A scientific yet accessible guide to herbs, vitamins and minerals, co-written by a physician whose herbal therapy study  was published in &lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once considered alternative medicine has made its way into the mainstream; half of all Americans have tried some from of complementary medicine, and more than $15 billion is spent annually on natural remedies. It is no surprise, then, that there&#39;s a tremendous amount of misinformation on the subject, leaving consumers searching for a solid and reliable book. &lt;i&gt;A Doctors Guide to Herbs and Supplements&lt;/i&gt; is that book, providing readers with the scientifically documented facts they need to make informed decisions about taking herbs and supplemnents. Based on up-to-date medical research, this comprehensive guide explains what these compounds are and demystifies how they do-or don&#39;t- work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the book are A to Z entries for the 100 most commonly used medicinal herbs and nutritional supplements.  Each entry details what the herb or supplement is, if and how it works, who shouldn&#39;t use it, and how it may interact with other medications.  Focusing on consumer safety, Dr. DiPaola offers a checklist of questions anyone should ask before using a medicinal herb, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Am I currently taking a prescription medication?&lt;br&gt;*Do I have any underlying medical conditions?&lt;br&gt;*What does this label tell me?  And what  doesn&#39;t it say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An invaluable reference, &lt;i&gt;A Doctors Guide to Herbs and Supplements&lt;/i&gt; is the ideal choice for the busy consumer looking for a concise, user-friendly book about the most commonly used natural remedies and revitalizers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
