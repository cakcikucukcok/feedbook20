  <title>SNACK TIME: Be Health-wise - Sylvia Dapper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Snack time is a delightful, compact book to read ad be carried about as the foods being discussed in it are delightful and delicious to eat and compact to be carried about, &amp;nbsp;as well as super beneficial to the individual&amp;rsquo;s health. By researching and writing &amp;lsquo;Snack Time&amp;rsquo;, Sylvia Dapper has drawn together a miscellany of sound, practical advice on what makes up a good balanced diet, made up of food which is not only easy to procure and then prepare, but which is also kind to one&amp;rsquo;s pocket &amp;ndash; the last-mentioned being unlike many of the so-called &amp;lsquo;slimming&amp;rsquo; meals. Sylvia details why these foods are healthy, what benefits they bring to the human body, and how they can form the basis of a wide miscellany of delicious snacks &amp;ndash; ones that not only taste good, but which are also doing good at the same time. Read, eat and enjoy in today&amp;rsquo;s world where, seemingly, a perfect appearance is all-important. Anyone looking to discover a balanced diet is faced with a bewildering choice of what to eat in order to become healthy. What seems to be the in-thing one day is quickly swept away by supposed evidence from another part of the media, whether it be social, television, radio, newspapers or the internet. This is a must read book for anyone looking to stay healthy and looking good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
