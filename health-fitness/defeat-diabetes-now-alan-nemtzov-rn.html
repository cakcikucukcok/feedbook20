  <title>Defeat Diabetes Now - Alan Nemtzov Rn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is inspiring to see how someone with type II diabetes can lose over one hundred pounds and quit taking medications just by changing his attitude. I believe that this is a must read for anyone who is depressed and overweight, even if you do not have diabetes. I will be recommending this book to my some of my friends. This is definitely worth the read. The author does an excellent job of explaining how diabetes works, and he does so in an easy-to-understand language. His medical background provides insights into the disease that is hard to find. He goes on to talk about how the effects of diabetes can be controlled by making simple lifestyle changes. You will be provided with a new outlook on life, and you will live a healthier life. This book is not preachy; it is honest and from someone who knows the true struggles of diabetes." />
