  <title>The Dream Belongs to the Dreamer - Velva Lee Heraty Msw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Dream Belongs to the Dreamer is a compelling hands-on, how-to guide professionally designed to help you unravel the mysteries of your dreams.  You will be expertly guided through chapter after chapter of steps, techniques, definitions, and examples to help you more fully understand your dreams on their deepest levels.  Five fascinating true-life stories of insightful dream dialogues are included to show you just how rewarding and meaningful this new method, called Subjective Symbol Immersion, truly is. Included are sections set aside for your personal notes and reflections so you can go at your own pace. In addition, to help make your dreamwork journey as meaningful as possible, there is a Dreamers Toolkit of wonderful and fun exercises and a Glossary of Terms in the back of the book. Here is one readers review: 
From time to time Ive been jolted by an extraordinary book that stops my world. It forces me to look at reality in a different way, a more expansive and meaningful way in which I can more easily connect to my true self. The Dream Belongs to the Dreamer is such a book.  It will help anyone willing to apply its unique method to their dreams achieve a healthy and creative life in harmony and balance. I know it did for me.
