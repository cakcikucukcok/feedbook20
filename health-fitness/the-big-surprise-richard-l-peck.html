  <title>The Big Surprise - Richard L. Peck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When aging parents start needing help living safely at home, you can be in for a big surprise. The help available can be more expensive than you ever imagined. And some of the resources available, nursing homes in particular, can be scary beyond belief. Never send me to a nursing home is a common plea from older family members. Author Richard L. Peck knows this as well as anyonehe went through the experience with his aging mother. But he comes at it from a different angle than most: he spent 18 years editing a magazine, Long-Term Living, that covered every aspect of long-term care. He saw the good, as well as the bad and ugly. He also became aware of the growing choices available to families seeking help with long-term care, choices you may not have heard much about, but they could save a great deal of money, emotional stress and frustration. These readable, bit-sized blogs will introduce you to a world you probably didnt know existed, one that will help you take care of Mom and Dad better than you thought possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
