      <meta name="description" content="Do you want to be successful? Of course, you say, everyone wants to be successful, yet how many people know what it takes or how to develop what it takes or even know what it looks like? Is success fame or wealth, or is it something else?
Not everyone can be famous or rich, yet everyone can be successful. Success is within the grasp of anyone who learns how to turn the cards they were dealt into a winning hand.
Winning at the Card Game of Life not only identifies the behaviors and approach involved in someone being successful, but also how you can develop those same skills yourself. Through the example of everyday people who achieved success, you can see how you too can win at the card game of life.
***********************
Everyone wants to succeed . . . and everyone can. Winning at the Card Game of Life shows how success does not depend upon the cards you were dealt, but rather how you play them. Success starts with learning how commitment, attitude, resources, decision making, and scheme (CARDS) make up the foundation of all successful people. A journey through the lives of twenty-three seemingly commonyet also dedicated, inspirational, and successful peopleconfirms the books premise that there are many roads to success. To help the reader with their own journey to success, there are exercises included in the book for self-exploration and skill development. The lessons, role models, and tools found in Winning at the Card Game of Life show how anyone can turn the cards they were dealt into a winning hand.

Winning at the Card Game of Life is a book that was designed with the young adult in mind but is applicable to anyone who is seeking the road to success. The basic premise of the book is that Success depends not on the cards you were dealt, but rather on how you play them. There are twenty-three stories of successful people, such as a circus clown, a chief of police, and a POW who, through the course of their lives, reached a level of personal success. The book reveals that their success is hidden in the CARDS, which stands for: commitment, attitude, resources, decision making, and scheme. The book concludes with identifying how the reader can develop and apply these attributes to their journey to success. There are also exercises in the book that can be used in the classroom to teach theses concepts.
Winning at the Card Game of Life is for anyone who wants to create and achieve a successful life. Based upon the basic premise that Success depends not on the cards you were dealt, but rather on how you play them, the book reveals how everyone can be successful. Through the use of twenty-three life stories of noncelebrity yet successful people as examples, Dr. McGlenn develops the concept that success is hidden in the CARDS and how everyone can design their own blueprint for success." />
