  <title>Gwenda’S Home Baking: Country Style - Gwenda Davis, Wilma Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;About ten years ago, Mum gave me two of her old exercise books, which contained a lot of handwritten recipes she had collected since 1953. I transcribed these, to preserve them for posterity, as the ink was fading and was diffi cult to read. I remember using these books as a teenager on the farm, baking on weekends to fill the cookie jar and make some cakes for the farm hands. As a lover of good home baking, Mums recipes have always been there to produce some of those nostalgic smells of freshly baked cakes and biscuits. I loved baking for my kids when they were growing up, and they always preferred Mums baked cakes and biscuits over anything bought from the supermarkets.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mum has seen it all whilst on the farm. Shes been through droughts and fl oods, good and bad times, and has had her share of adversities. She is a survivor of breast cancer and is currently cancer-free. She has been an inspiration to all of us growing up, and this is one way of giving a little of that back. I have three sisters, and we all cannot stress enough to all women to keep vigilant with self examination and mammograms, as early detection will equal early intervention and good outcomes. I use a lot of these recipes for fundraisers.&lt;/P&gt;" />
