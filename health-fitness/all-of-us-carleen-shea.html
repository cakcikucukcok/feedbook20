      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;If you read the first book about this family entitled Emily, you will recognize most of these characters and be introduced to more as the saga&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;continues. Fate brings Emily Jones to a farmhouse outside of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Perryville&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Kentucky&lt;/st1:State&gt; in the heart of the great Depression when her car breaks down on the way to her sisters home in &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Virginia&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;. She and her children have no money and no food. They are prepared to beg for something to eat and to be allowed to sleep in the barn. They stay on by making themselves indispensable to a household that has recently lost its wife and mother. There they make an amazing discovery. This is a story of people adapting to hard situations and decisions in hard times. It is a story of misplaced people and some of the things they had to do to survive. It is the story of a country in turmoil. It starts in 1931 and goes through to 1982. This book, All Of Us, starts out with Emily in 1904, when she is 2 years old and is told in the first person by each character. It is indicative of individual views on some of the same situations. The history of our country factors into this book, also. The Brown family extends into a loving, caring family of a hundred people from &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Kentucky&lt;/st1:State&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/st1:State&gt;, &lt;st1:City w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Texas&lt;/st1:State&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, and &lt;st1:State w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; who decide to have a family reunion after World War II. It ends with a tragedy in 1950. The next book will be More About the Rest of Us and will cover 1950 to 1986 with some flashbacks to earlier times.&lt;/P&gt;" />
