      <meta name="description" content="World’s first Empowerment Script Book. An excellent aide for adults and children with psycho-trauma or dissociation. Everyone can read this for relaxation, neuroplastic potential and creativity. A breakthrough discovery. Patented. And it’s a great story about Sam the Tram.
Psycho-traumatologists may find the book a powerful tool in their therapeutic practice for psycho-trauma, dissociation and general mental exhaustion. 
The formatting of the text in this book has been designed specifically to stimulate neural connectivity to supplement development suppressed since the intense experiences of trauma. This book can be used in conjunction with psychotherapy.

just &gt; as &gt; you &gt; are &gt; reading,
.reverse &lt; in &lt; written &lt; next &lt; the &lt; and
Empowerment Script is a relaxing way to stimulate neural pathways between both hemispheres of the brain. Psycho-traumatologists with experience in EMDR will readily see the possibilities. The ancient Greeks read forwards and backwards - was this an element of their inventiveness ?

Lowen Clarke has been researching personal and socio-psycho-trauma for many years. He lives in Maryborough, one of the Gold Cities of Victoria, Australia. ‘Empowerment Script is the best creation I have contributed. I first created it in 2003. I hope you enjoy this latest evolution.&#39;" />
