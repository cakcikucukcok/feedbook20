  <title>Do It Right - George Mugume</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Humans I guess even animals generally dont like being told what to do or how to do it; for the human, even by God. Everyone wants to go his own way and do his own thing, because it feels good and above all free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sex saturated world where even an ad for takeout chicken, can feature a beautiful girl and have the caption We like chicks with big thighs, its almost impossible to get away from sex in one form or another. Can a God of another millennium and his ways be relevant to us today?  Does he have anything to say that matters to this generation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has enough gloom and doom on its own without another lecture. We need to really get it or the lectures just may not do it. Once we get it, hopefully we will overcome our base nature and will successfully run the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it Right&lt;/em&gt; will take you on a journey that will delight you, make you laugh, enable you to THINK and above all to &lt;em&gt;Do it Right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
