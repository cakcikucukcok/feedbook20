  <title>Holding Her Head High - Janine Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life lessons from single mothers throughout history form the inspiration for single mothers today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Single moms are not just a product of our modern culture. There have been single mothers throughout history, women who have raised not only their children but also nations with a higher vision for life. &lt;em&gt;Holding Her Head High&lt;/em&gt; recounts stories of twelve such women from the third to the twenty-first centuries, women who found ways to twist their fates to represent God&#39;s destiny for their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These uniquely powerful, brave women, within the scope of their own world and times, are like the ninety-nine percent of single mothers today who never intended to carry that distinction. They are abandoned, widowed, or divorced, all carrying wounds, yet they also all found ways to exhibit courage, kindness, dignity, and faith to heal themselves by healing others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actress Janine Turner, herself a single mother, describes the social implications for women and children from the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages to Pioneer days, including a single mother of slavery. Stories from women like Rachel Lavein Fawcett, abandoned single mother of Alexander Hamilton; Abagail Adams, a wartime widow; Harriet Jacobs, an unwed mother of slavery whose autobiography was published the year the Civil War began; and widowed Belva Lockwood, the first woman to officially run for President, all carrying wounds but all offering insight, wisdom, and encouragement. Lessons include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Listen for God&#39;s higher calling&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hold your head high&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dare to dream&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Champion your children&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Heal with humor&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t Give Up Before the Miracle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
