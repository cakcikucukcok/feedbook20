  <title>Back in the Day 2: - Rob French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Back in the Day 2:  The College Years continues the journey of Mike, Kirk, Kyle and Philip as they
enter college and embark on a new world outside of the home they left behind in Missouri.
It shows how these teens learned on their own how to mature and grow into decent caring
people.
They had their moments when their relationships were tested and how they overcame tragedy all
while allowing their love to grow and flourish.  It also shows how their love reached out and brought
their families closer together and to unite as one family. 
Many have said &quot;family life was not like that in the 1970&#39;s&quot;, my only response was &quot;But, you didn&#39;t personally know ever family. I knew a couple of families that were very supportive of their gay
sons and daughters back then&quot; 
It truly is amazing what the unconditional love of family can conquer and overcome." />
