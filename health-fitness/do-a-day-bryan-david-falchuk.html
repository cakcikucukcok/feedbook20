  <title>Do a Day - Bryan David Falchuk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bryan Falchuk overcame adversity, lost nearly 100 pounds, ran a marathon, became vegan and created an approach to help others live a better life, every day. &lt;strong&gt;That &amp;nbsp;way is Do a Day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people, Bryan has faced challenges in life, like obesity, depression, work stress, the responsibilities of parenthood, the potential of losing his wife to illness, and more. And he struggled, like anyone else. Through that struggle, Bryan learned the secret to not just overcoming any individual challenge, but creating a life of achievement, happiness and harmony. In Do a Day, you will learn how to make each day contribute to your goals so you can live the life you want to live &amp;ndash; a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a Day will free you of the burden and judgment of yesterday&amp;lsquo;s choices, while relieving you of the pressure of what tomorrow may bring. By teaching you how to identify your true motivation and how to use that to focus on what you have to do today, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do a Day will help you change your life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
