  <title>Generation XL - Joseph Mercola, Ben Lerner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Childhood is a pivotal time for good nutrition. Organs and blood streams nurtured with junk food cannot build a foundation for good health and longevity as an adult. Drs. Joseph Mercola and Ben Lerner believe profound inactivity, addiction to electronic media, and diets of super-sized fast food and sugar-laden beverages have created a national emergency. &lt;em&gt;Generation XL&lt;/em&gt; is a clarion call and a detailed guide to giving your child a vibrant, successful future and a healthy, wholesome, invigorating youth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As children riddled with pain, illness, learning disorders, and even depression begin to show up everywhere, rather than looking at brain development, nutrition, and lack of movement as the culprits, concerned parents are turning to more and more medications. Think about that. Is that how we were designed? To make medication a way of life and to be drugged early on a consistent basis?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does the future hold for us when kids are overweight, out of shape, and taking medications for the effects? What kind of children are we creating?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not a diet book-far, far from it. Dropping another diet book into the same culture will do nothing but take up more room on your shelf. &lt;em&gt;Generation XL&lt;/em&gt; shows you how kids were created to eat, breathe, sleep, run, and live. At the same time, Drs. Mercola and Lerner help you change your family culture and recognize where the culture around you isn&#39;t working so you can avoid it or help to change it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since prevention is always easier (and wiser) than cure, incorporating the lifestyle changes suggested in &lt;em&gt;Generation XL&lt;/em&gt; gives your child a realistic way to reach and maintain a healthy weight; dramatically reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other health risks; and build a strong body and positive mental attitude, maximizing his or her IQ and giving the best chance for success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
