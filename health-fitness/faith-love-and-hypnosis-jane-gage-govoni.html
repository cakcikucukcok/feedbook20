  <title>Faith Love and Hypnosis - Jane Gage Govoni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you do if one minute you were healthy and the next you had a major stroke? What if you were told you had lost 1/3 of your brain and were not expected to live? What if Western Medicine had no treatment for your rare brain disease? This is exactly what happened to Jane and this is her story of healing. 
All I can say about Janes story is, Wow, a Warrior Woman for sure. This is a phenomenal story of the resiliency of her indomitable spirit in recovery from a stroke, mixed with the best of traditional healing arts she incorporated, makes for a read you wont be able to put down. Hands down, a wonderful book of inspiration and hope. Read this book.

Janes book, Faith, Love, Hypnosis, is a remarkable sojourn of The Heros Journey.  Moreover, it is a playbook for not only coping with stress, but epitomizing how we can reach our highest human potential. Informative. Intuitive. Inspiring.for everyone.
