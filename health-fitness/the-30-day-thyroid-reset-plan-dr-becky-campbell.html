  <title>The 30-Day Thyroid Reset Plan - Dr. Becky Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get Your Health Back for Good In 30 Days&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have thyroid disorders and don&#39;t even know it. Dr. Becky Campbell, who has years of experience in the field, was one of those people but cured herself using this revolutionary program. What makes this approach different--and more effective for lifelong results--is that it looks for root causes and offers a well-rounded, holistic treatment plan that addresses lifestyle, diet, environmental toxins and more. This way, you can fix the underlying problem rather than covering up the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the thyroid affects every system in the body, a whole host of symptoms can arise and can vary from person to person. To help individuals find the root cause of their thyroid disorder, Dr. Becky Campbell explains the seven hidden triggers that cause illness: gut infections, leaky gut and food sensitivities, vitamin deficiencies, HPA-axis imbalance, heavy metal toxicity, sex hormone dysfunction and chronic infections. She then provides her all-natural treatment plan, which includes a highly effective and easy-to-follow 30-day reset diet, so you can find which foods work for your body and which do not. She will also help you adjust your lifestyle with recipes for toxin-free products, ways to reduce stress and much more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in your health and use &lt;i&gt;The 30-Day Thyroid Reset Plan &lt;/i&gt;to heal your body for life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
