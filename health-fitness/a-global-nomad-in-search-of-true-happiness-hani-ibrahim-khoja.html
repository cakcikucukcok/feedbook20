  <title>A Global Nomad in Search of True Happiness - Hani Ibrahim Khoja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each and every human being in history has been created to make the world a better place. Some of us have been blessed with more health, wealth, wisdom, and security. But all of us have a unique ability to make a difference. There is a compelling Quran verse informing us that all living beings have been chosen by God as his khalifas (agents and inheritors) on earth. The question that constantly whispers in my ear and drives my every action is In what specific ways can I be Gods khalifa? 
With so much chaos surrounding us, where would I start? I had recently felt confused. I wanted to do something, but I didnt know what. And so this book emerged. Writing it has been a process to overcome my paralysis and start the momentum. Through this self-reflection, I have come up with a five-step formula to living happily forever. 
Firstly, I hope this book will inspire others to determine their ultimate destiny as Ive attempted to do. Secondly, I hope to provide a roadmap for others toward an eternal life of happiness by helping those less fortunate, utilizing our unique skills and interests. Thirdly, I hope to bridge the gap between the American and Saudi cultures. Extremists have created unjustified distrust on both sides. Most Americans feel Saudis are violent, backward, and unapproachable, while many Saudis see Americans as imperialistic warmongers. 
Having lived most of my life between both cultures, I will highlight the similar values and beliefs Americans and Saudis share. I aim to outvoice the extremists, who have thus far dominated the conversation, and to provide a realistic picture of both cultures." />
