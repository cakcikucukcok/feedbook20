  <title>Grief Sucks ... But Love Bears All Things: How Grief Tore Me Apart and Put Me Back Together - Gayle Taylor Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt; Gayle Taylor Davis had it all &amp;#8212; a husband she adored, two successful daughters, and a career she enjoyed. Then one phone call took it all away, when a policeman called to tell her that her husband of 32 years had suddenly died of a heart attack. Plunged into the strange new world of grief, Davis began to write to make sense of her experience.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt; &amp;#8220;Grief Sucks: But Love Bears All Things&amp;#8221; is Davis&amp;#8217;s personal account of how she climbed out of grief, step by painful step &amp;#8212; a no-holds-barred look at personal pain that is rarely shared or talked about. Davis reveals the worst moments of her grief &amp;#8212; days of tears, nights of wailing, and thoughts of suicide&amp;#8212; and teaches the reader through her example that one can survive the worst.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt; A brutally honest and intimate portrayal of raw grief in all its pain and ugliness, &amp;#8220;Grief Sucks&amp;#8221; rejects simpleminded words of comfort to address loss with simple home truths: This is the worst pain you will ever feel. And you will survive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
