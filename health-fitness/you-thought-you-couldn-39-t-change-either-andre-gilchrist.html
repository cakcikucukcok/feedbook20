  <title>You Thought You Couldn&#39;t Change, Either - Andre’ Gilchrist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;You Thought You Couldn&#39;t Change, Either&quot; is a book about the true accounts of the life of Andre Gilchrist. The book is written by Andre Gilchrist and explores how this individual went from living a life of serenity and peacefulness to living a life full of mental, physical, intellectual and spiritual degradation and how he was able to bring himself out of that lifestyle to living the life he lives and enjoys today. The book is written in two parts: &quot;You Thought You Couldn&#39;t Change, Either&quot; and &quot;Fear of Intimacy.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book is written with the intention of allowing people to see and internalize the concept that no matter where one is in their life process that they can stop and turn their lives around. The first part of the book is devoted to showing in a chronological process the writer hitting rock bottom and then working his way out of that predicament. The second part of the book deals with the concept of intimacy as it was pivotal in the writer&#39;s life. It also deals with the life and struggles of the author and a more intense look into the internal structure of the individual.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is the story of one individual&#39;s struggle within himself. This is the story of one individual&#39;s journey from desperation to determination. This is the story of an individual exposing his weaknesses in life and having those same weaknesses manifest later in that individual as strengths. His is the story of an individual who has learned in life that everyone has to trust others and allow others to help him and that no one is completely independent of other people.&lt;/P&gt;
