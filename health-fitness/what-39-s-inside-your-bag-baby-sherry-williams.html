  <title>What&#39;s Inside Your Bag Baby? - Sherry Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you ever feel like your life seems identical to that of your parents or the ones who acted as your parents? Could it be the complete opposite? Have you ever taken the time to stop and look at how you were reared? 
Perhaps, the way you have been living could be because of those JEANS (GENES) you are wearing. 
What&#39;s Inside Your Bag Baby? is a self-help book--an awareness guide--to really make you think about the choices you have made, why you have made them and why you are in your current situations.  You see, whether we realize it or not, as human beings, we are going to do what we have been shown from our past--we make choices based on how we have been conditioned to make them.  We follow the same comfortable behavior patterns and we continually choose and follow relationship models with which we are familiar.  You will clearly see what influences determine the Jeans (Genes) you are wearing, how they have and continue to control and affect you, the types you possibly have been collecting, and how easily you can pass them down to your children.  You will understand why you should let those old Jeans (Genes) go and STRATEGIES to help you do so, such as:~Removing those RCG Lenses,~Not Taking all the Blame,~Mentally Cutting Those Controlling Cords, and ~Parenting the Child Within. 
I want all of you to be aware that we all wear &quot;Hammy&quot; down Jeans (Genes) --- it&#39;s our baggage --- and none of us is an exception! You ask why you should read this book and travel light in your new Jeans (Genes) --- &quot;Because You are Worth it!&quot;" />
