  <title>Foothold in the Mountain - Constance Caruso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A compelling story of a womans determination and spirit, proof that most things are possible with courage; a faith that indeed moves mountains and opens doors for others to succeed in the generations that follow.
At twenty-four Connie Caruso was a secretary in a prestigious talent agency.  It was 1950s Hollywood, when the studio controlled its stars.  Glamour ruled: Connie rubbed shoulders with Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, Judy Garland, Clark Gable, Grace Kelly, et al.  She lived in a world of fairytales and ambition.  
A clandestine affair with the father of a major celebrity went south when Connie became pregnant.  He offered to marry her, but not before suggesting abortion.  Fueled by fury, she left him after she had a back street abortion.  Within a few months, lonely and depressed, Connie invited David, an Adonis-like beach boy from Santa Monica, to move in with her.  She soon realized her mistake and threw him out.  Too late, she discovered she was pregnant again.  
Against advice from psychiatrist, friends and sister, she decided to have this baby, forging ahead into the unknown.  She took on the Welfare system in Los Angeles and New York, called in markers from friends, and implored an old Brooklyn boyfriend, Johnny, to marry her.  Nothing worked.  Hardened by adversity, her child became her raison detre and taught her the power of love.  This ultimately motivated her to realize her dreams.  
Connie became a media personality with a 15-year run as co-host of Frankly Female, a groundbreaking talk show on KCAL-TVs channel 9, and has accomplished independence and good fortune in more ways than she could ever have imagined. 
Most important, she continues to carry the message that there are many footholds in the mountain and many options for happiness." />
