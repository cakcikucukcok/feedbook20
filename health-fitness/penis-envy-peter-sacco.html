  <title>Penis Envy - Peter Sacco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Valuable information about what many of us have been questioning for years, but perhaps were afraid to ask. Politically correct has no place in Penis Envy but rather raw principles to age old concerns about behavior.” – Dr. Debra Laino DHS, MS, Sex Therapist/Sex Educator
“Holy cow! This book is hilarious and so real! My husband has Penis Envy for sure after reading this book!.” – Cheryl T.
“I couldn’t put this book down… only when I wiped the tears from my eyes because I laughed so hard!” – Sal Salvador, Incon Creative Solutions.
What in the world is penis envy? Good question. Penis Envy is inspired from the work of Sigmund Freud and the reason women are envious of men. In this book, the authors flipped it around and showed today’s reality of how it applies more to the envy many men have toward one another. So what happens when a man has penis envy?
This book explains many of the quirks, idiosyncrasies, bizarre and ridiculous lifestyles many adult men lead today. And women want answers!
Penis Envy will help shed light on some of life’s more perplexing questions:
• Why do so many adult men still live at home with their parents?
• Why are some adult men attached to mom at the hip, unable to let go?
• Why do some men feel the need to ‘stuff’ themselves?
• Why do some men wear clothes and bathing suits that are way too tight?
• Why do some men dress like women – metrosexuals?
• Why are some men so proud of their large beer bellies and breasts?
• Can a guy be more in love with his truck or favorite team than his partner?
Penis Envy will try to answer these questions and more. In the end, it will answer… Does size really matter?" />
