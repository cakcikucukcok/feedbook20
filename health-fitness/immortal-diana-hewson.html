  <title>Immortal - Diana Hewson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A personal account of one woman&#39;s experiences and revelations of an afterlife following her husband&#39;s sudden death ... an expression of the depth of love that bound two people together even beyond death.&quot;  Kirkus Reviews
****************
Diana Hewsons husband, Ed, passed away suddenly of a heart attack in May of 2003. They were extremely close and had somewhat isolated themselves from friends since they mainly enjoyed just being together. They had no children and no close relatives. Diana was alone except for some good friends. Initially, she had a hard time comprehending what had happened, but she knew that it was up to her to proceed with life. 
&lt;p&gt;
Diana and Ed had been married for thirty-four years. They were not religious and they did not believe in life after death. When Ed did die, several close friends suggested that Ed would be communicating since they were so close. Diana was appreciative of their words and thoughts but did not believe them. Then unexplainable things began to happen. And about four months after his passing, Ed managed to make Diana realize they were right. Ed was still there and communicating. 
&lt;p&gt;
This is Dianas amazing story of how she learned that when someone close dies, it is not an end to the relationship. The relationship merely changes form. She now knows there is life after death. 
&lt;p&gt;
Diana wrote this book to help others work through the grief from losing a loved one by understanding there is life after death and we are all truly immortal." />
