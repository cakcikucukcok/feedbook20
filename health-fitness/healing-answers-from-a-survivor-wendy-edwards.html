  <title>Healing Answers from a Survivor - Wendy Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Healing Answers from a Survivor includes pages of practical information and strategies to make your journey from victim to survivor a possibility. I have included every aspect of surviving abuse that I have personally encountered. Consequently, it is a very detailed and comprehensive book spanning most areas. There are countless situations that arise from having been abused, and I have included the answers that I used to help me to recover. &lt;br /&gt;
Regardless of our stories, the emotions that we experience are all the same; indeed, conditional and unconditional love, sorrow, fear, anxiety, hate, and anger all feature strongly with abuse. Our body issues, emotional problems, and issues with power and control are discussed.&lt;br /&gt;
Remembering the abuse and facing the heartbreaking truth are all part of the healing process. Ultimately, to heal we need to acknowledge and release the accompanying emotions, break our previously learned patterns of behavior, and focus positively on our recovery, both now and into the future. Most importantly, we need to become survivors, not victims, martyrs, rescuers, or abusers. &lt;br /&gt;
I believe that true recovery comes when we heal and become survivors by standing in our truth and taking full responsibility for our lives. It is possible to heal, take back your personal power, and become a survivor, like I did. &lt;br /&gt;
With love, Wendy x" />
