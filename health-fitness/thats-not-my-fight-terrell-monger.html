  <title>Thats Not My Fight - Terrell Monger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people will try to give you advice on the type of mate you should have, the type of job you should pursue, or the type of life you should live. If you are not careful, you will let someone put their own goals and expectations on you and have you chasing a life you do not truly desire. 
The most frustrating thing in life would be to work hard for an idea that was placed in your head, only to achieve it and find out that it is not what you really wanted. Your natural instincts, gifts, and interests can lead you to the exact place that you desire to be if you would stop looking for someone to agree with you before you start going after it. 
This book is designed to challenge you to return to your original form. It will help you develop your best self so you can live your best life. Love awaits. Life awaits. The world needs to see who you are!" />
