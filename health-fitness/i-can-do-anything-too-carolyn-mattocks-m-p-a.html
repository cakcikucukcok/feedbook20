  <title>I Can Do Anything, Too - Carolyn Mattocks M.P.A.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The I Can Do Anything curriculum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enables youth to examine various careers and opportunities by demonstrating the significant achievements that Latino Americans have made in various fi elds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I Can Do Anything curriculum consists of:&lt;br&gt;
*An overview of various careers with the skills needed to excel in each field&lt;br&gt;
*Historical References&lt;br&gt;
*Famous Latino Americans in each career field&lt;br&gt;
*Exercises in skill assessments, self-assessments,
research, and writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many occasions, I have seen the joy and satisfaction that Latinos express for their heritage. This book brings to surface the many accomplishments and positive infl uences that Latinos have on America. &lt;br&gt;
Eric Hawthorne, Department of Army&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Mattocks has followed up with a sequel to her fi rst book, with I Can Do Anything, Too. Anyone who loves history or anyone seeking to learn more about the contributors of other cultures should purchase this book. I look forward for future books. &lt;br&gt;
Anniette Keyes, East Carolina University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an extremely valuable tool for young people. It can also be used by parents and counselors to help guide young people to the proper career. I would recommend this book to anyone. &lt;br&gt;
