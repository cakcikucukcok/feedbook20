  <title>The Dental Patient’S Survival Guide - Ellen Broyles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;TESTIMONIALS&lt;/center&gt;br&gt;&lt;vr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen is our dental angel advocate. Her book exposes all the murky and sometimes secretive details of the dental industry, such as fillings, root canals, crowns, implants, dentures, and more, and the expenses and insurance involved. She presents the information in such an easy to read and informative manner that its not possible any longer to wonder whether to trust a dental professional or his/her treatment or not. Hooray for Ellen Broyles! I can honestly say that I appreciate her writing this book; the information has been kept un-der cover for too long. Thanks, Ellen.&lt;br&gt;
Terry Mills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen the book is great! I sat down to just read a chapter or two and ended up finishing it because it was so fun, definitely not the typical, dry literature youd read about a medical profession! The structure and content were perfect. Thanks for sending me along a copy; I think its a great idea to educate patients!&lt;br&gt;
Casey Caraher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen has personally saved our family thousands of dollars by intercepting treatment plans that would have drained our bank accounts. We cant thank her enough for her time and caring attitude for us and many of our other family members that have gone to her for dental advocacy. She was able to inform us with alternative suggestions and refer us to other dentists that were able to provide them.&lt;br&gt;
Marcy Dodds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister was in severe dental pain one evening; we were referred to Ellen to help us find available dental resources and she was able to find a clinic that worked on a sliding fee schedule. Both my sister and I thank you Ellen! Thanks to your recommendation, she received wonderful dental care that she could afford! Thank you again.&lt;br&gt;
Debby Cabales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always called Ellen over the years to get a second opinion of the treatment plan I received from various dentists. She has always been able to either agree with the dentists plan of treatment or disagree offering viable options for me. I will continue to ask her advice when it comes to hard decisions with my dental treatment. &lt;br&gt;
Nancy White&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin was in dire need of dental help Not only did she lack the funds for dental treatment but she was very scared of dentists in general. Not only did Ellen take the time to find her an adequate but inexpensive dental insurance plan for her, but she also found her a very empathetic dentist to work with Gwen. Ellen even brought her to her first appointment so she would feel more comfortable. Thank you, Ellen&lt;br&gt;
