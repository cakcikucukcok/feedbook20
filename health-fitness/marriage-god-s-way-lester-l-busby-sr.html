  <title>Marriage, God’S Way - Lester L Busby  Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lord God said, It is not good that man should be alone: I will make him a helpmeet for him 
and they shall be one flesh! (Gen. 2:18, 24). 
I have been praying for about seven years for a helpmate, according to Genesis 2:18 and 24 (and many other scriptures as well). Then I created a prayer petition (chapter 5). I began to get impatient that the Lord had not answered my prayers, actually questioning him. After all he said, not me, It is not good that man should be alone. 
I think he became tired of my plea and impatience, so the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, Lester, I havent answered your prayer yet because you are not ready. I was stunned! I decided to go to the Bible because I believe all answers and instructions are in his Word. I went to the book of Genesis and realized the importance of marriage Gods way. 
This book is the result of what God has revealed to me." />
