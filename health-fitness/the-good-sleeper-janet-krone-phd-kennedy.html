  <title>The Good Sleeper - Janet Krone PhD Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A refreshingly straightforward method for training infants to become great sleepers for life, inspired by clinical psychologist Janet Kennedy&#39;s popular psychotherapy practice, NYC Sleep Doctor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cry it out or co-sleep? Bassinet or swing? White noise machine or Bach? How many hours anyway? For something so important, there&#39;s too much conflicting information about how best to get your baby to sleep through the night and nap successfully during the day. This book is a straightforward, no-nonsense answer to one of the biggest challenges new parents face when they welcome a brand new baby home. This book is written for exhausted parents, giving them immediate access to the information they need. Reassuring and easy to understand, Dr. Kennedy addresses head-on the fears and misinformation about the long-term effects of crying and takes a bold stand on controversial issues such as co-sleeping and attachment parenting. With polarizing figures and techniques dominating the marketplace--and spawning misinformation across the internet--Dr. Kennedy&#39;s methods and practices create an extensively researched and parent-tested approach to sleep training that takes both babies&#39; and parents&#39; needs into account to deliver good nights and days of sleep, and no small dose of peace of mind. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Good Sleeper&lt;/i&gt; is a practical, empowering--and even entertaining--guide to help parents understand infant sleep. This research-based book will teach parents the basics of sleep science, determine how and when to intervene, and provide tools to solve even the most seemingly impossible sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;" />
