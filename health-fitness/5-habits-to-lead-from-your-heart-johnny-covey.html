  <title>5 Habits to Lead from Your Heart - Johnny Covey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 5 Habits to Lead from Your Heart, author and coach, Johnny Covey presents a powerful new way to change how we perceive experiences; how we make decisions and how we interpret events. Often we filter experiences through a lens that does not include our hearts. Harmful habits can form when we act out of fear or self-preservation (our head) instead of using our heart. But habits can be changed. Johnny illustrates how to understand better our human nature and unleash its potential; to lead from your heart, live courageously and create the life you want. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So many times we are in a reactive mode, not thinking about what we are doing. Have we ever stopped and asked:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is holding me back?
&lt;li&gt;Why don’t I have relationships that I want?
&lt;li&gt;Why am I  stuck in my head, worried about what others think of me?
&lt;li&gt;How can I free myself from ruts and routines?
&lt;li&gt;How might I choose to live courageously in my heart?
&lt;li&gt;How can I consciously create the life I am meant to live?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnny helps us understand the genesis of our results—our mind—and our own system of checks and balances—our conscience. By combining what we currently know with Covey’s 5 Habits, we will have everything we need to elevate our thinking, take the next step—and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;5 Habits to Lead from Your Heart is a rare wake-up call  in our search for meaning.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;~Greg Link, Co-author of &lt;em&gt;Smart Trust&lt;/em&gt;, Co-founder CoveyLink&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another winner in the Covey tradition.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;~Doug Conant, former CEO,  Campbell Soup and Chairman, Avon Products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ If you want a book that is bone honest, practical, personal and profound, this is it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; ~Scott C.
