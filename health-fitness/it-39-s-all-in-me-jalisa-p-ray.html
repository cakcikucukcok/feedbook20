  <title>It&#39;s All in Me! - Jalisa P Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is&amp;nbsp;a memoir about all that I had to overcome to realize&amp;nbsp;that I had everything I needed within me to succeed in life and ministry. I have had to overcome a lot to get on my journey to freedom and living abundantly. I tried to turn to many outside sources but it all led back to me and what God had placed within me. He showed me that I am my purpose and that everything that I need to fulfill my purpose is inside of me. He&amp;rsquo;s given me a testimony that is like no other. Some things were done to me, others I did to myself. Instead of worry about who&amp;rsquo;s fault these things were, I decided to take responsibility for it all. I took responsibility for the abuse, neglect, rape, broken relationships, daddy issues, infidelity, STD, and brokenness. I decided to use it all as stepping stones instead of stumbling blocks. I decided that I would no longer indulge in self-sabotage and self-harming&amp;nbsp;behavior. I decided not to continue to&amp;nbsp;let my past define me. It is said that it is not what happens to you, it&amp;#39;s how you respond to it. How have you responded to your past experiences? Have you taken responsibility&amp;nbsp;for them by extracting the lessons from them for future experiences? Or, have you continue to play the blame game as a victim instead of a victor? I took responsibility by turning my pain into purpose and sharing it with you in this book in hopes that you too are able to turn your pain into purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reader said this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love how this book not only just tells a story, but it&amp;#39;s also like a self-help workbook inside asking you very thought-provoking, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;self-reflecting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; questions that really helps you dig deep and think about where your roadblocks are and how to break through those self-inflicting barriers. And then she also says a prayer for you in each segment for which you are going through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I commend Jalisa for opening up and sharing her story as it will help many have their breakthrough and heal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; their wounds. I felt like she was there with me working through to heal my wounds. Awesome book!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
