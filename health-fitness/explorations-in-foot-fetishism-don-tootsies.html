  <title>Explorations in Foot Fetishism - Don Tootsies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A foot fetish is depicted by the media as weird, or worse. But in actuality, it&amp;rsquo;s THE most common fetish. Millions of people have one. It&amp;rsquo;s the most normal, natural thing&amp;nbsp;in the world, despite how it&amp;rsquo;s portrayed. Foot fetishism has been recorded in every society and throughout history. This eBook is therefore to help dispel myths about foot fetishism. It&amp;rsquo;s for&amp;nbsp;a couple&amp;nbsp;looking for new ways to explore, a person who wants to learn more about it,&amp;nbsp;someone who has a partner with a foot&amp;nbsp;fetish,&amp;nbsp;or is considering approaching their partner with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this booklet you will learn: how normal a foot fetish actually is, the history of foot fetishism, the scientific and psychological basis, different aspects of the fetish, famous foot fetishists, aspects of the fetish and the verbiage associated with it, tips for him and her, an interview with a famous author &amp;amp; dominatrix, some moves to try, and three foot fetish, role-play scripts. The first is sensual domination, the second the bratty princess motif, and the third, total domination by the sadistic dominatrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I myself have had two partners who ended up loving foot play. The first was totally grossed initially and the second, hopelessly ticklish. In the end, both learned to love&amp;nbsp;foot worship. In fact, it became a spring board for exploring other kinks and sexual interests. With this eBook, I hope to allow couples a way to explore the fetish, one that helps bring them closer together and to reach new vistas of fulfillment and bliss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
