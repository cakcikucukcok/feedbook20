  <title>And Then She Smiled - Anne Cutler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is one womans story of thirty-four years of abuse and torture at the hands of the man she loved, until one day, at fifty-six years old, something snapped. This is her special journey.
Anne Cutler wrote this story in hopes of reaching other battered women and men out there. No matter what walk of life they have, they all share the same hopes, fears, and strengths. Yes, it takes lots of strength, but though we think we are weak, we are far from it.
Above all, they need to learn to love themselves, which is a hard lesson to learn, and to learn also that love should not hurt. Some people have to push others down to make themselves feel bigger.
Anne hopes to give strength to someone else that needs it and to let them know there is a wonderful, normal life out there that is full of beauty and wonder and love." />
