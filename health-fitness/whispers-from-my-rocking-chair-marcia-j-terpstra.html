  <title>Whispers from My Rocking Chair - Marcia J. Terpstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the LIGHT in my life.  This book is not my book.  It belongs to HIM.  After writing my first book, and His book too,  &quot;Splinters from my Rocking Chair&quot; that depicts the very dark in my life as a result of incest, I knew I had to write about the LIGHT in my life; the LIGHT that saved me.  
     I lived in so much darkness through so much of my life as a result of incest but also because of my religious upbringing.  This upbringing promoted the casting out of so many and I bought into it.  I believed in them, not HIM.  I then decided I had to stop fighting mankind and trying to prove my worthiness to them.
     I went to the GOSPELS and there I found Jesus and that He was on my side, not theirs.  He was against the so called religious.  He was on my side, our side.  He sought after the broken and the sick and all those who were so lost.  He loved all those who had gone astray and the weak in spirit.  He went after those who needed HIM.       
     This book is about my walk with JESUS!" />
