  <title>K.I.S.S. - Chuck Helmke, Charlotte Guttenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;K.I.S.S.: Keep Individual Security Simple&lt;/B&gt; by Chuck Helmke and Charlotte Guttenberg is a primer for individual security (self-defense). Although &lt;B&gt;K.I.S.S.&lt;/B&gt; offers advice and tips useful to any age group or gender, the writers are particularly interested in the concerns of senior citizens and people with disabilities, people who may think they cannot defend themselves. They do this utilizing a fictitious group of senior citizens and the problems they encounter with a gang that is victimizing them.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The writers are senior citizens who recognize issues that can easily be overlooked in other training courses by trainers who have yet to experience the tolls of age.
Helmke says, I have tried to address problems in a down-to-earth manner that is readily understandable, regardless of the present training level of students. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this type of training.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Statistically, the safest defensive solutions are avoidance, deterrence and de-escalation. They have proven to be absolutely the safest way to live your life. However, these three solutions can fail because of something we did not do or because of something totally out of our control. If avoidance, deterrence and de-escalation have failed to defuse a volatile or violent situation and a life-threatening situation is imminent, I have problems with the idea of hand-to-hand combat for most people. The only true equalizer for these types of potentially life-threatening situations, in my humble opinion, is a handgun. That is my defensive choice.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For whatever reasons, if you feel that is not your choice, then I will do my best to address some possible alternatives you may choose to use. That said, I feel the handgun is the best possible defensive weapon for anyone, especially women, senior citizens and people with disabilities. It might prepare you for the day I hope never comes.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the words of some experts in the world of defense who have read &lt;B&gt;K.I.S.S.: Keep Individual Security Simple&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brent Shepherd&lt;/B&gt;, Director of Operations at the American Police Hall of Fame Shooting Center says of &lt;B&gt;K.I.S.S.&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the most straightforward explanation of applied personal safety principles I have ever read. The concepts and practical applications are easy to follow and this book provides insights that can benefit everyone.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Retired Philadelphia policeman, &lt;B&gt;Steven O. Forester&lt;/B&gt; says:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book offers you the opportunity to learn how to be a survivor of the worst thing that could happen to you, the loss of your life or that of your loved ones. The world is changing and not always for the good. Dont let the bad guys win. Give yourself the edge to come out of that situation a winner. Remember, age is just a number, if you prepare your mind and body to do the task, it can be done.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Retired deputy sheriff, &lt;B&gt;C.J. Gibson&lt;/B&gt; says:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;After Mary became a victim of a purse snatching, Arthur and Louise, along with their neighbors decided not to be victims any longer and took some personal initiative to prepare themselves for individual security. In a society plagued with increasing violence, Helmke and Guttenberg provide an easy, fun read and practical advice for anyone interested in taking responsibility for their personal security. They deliver this advice utilizing an elderly couple with physical challenges and limitations often faced by our aging population. Helmke and Guttenberg are passionate and knowledgeable in the task of personal safety. They provide sound, real life, practical concepts to begin your quest of individual security.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Special Agent &lt;B&gt;Jeffrey Stover&lt;/B&gt;, Retired U.S. Secret Service says:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you decide to kill a fly -- you kill it with a sledgehammeryou know how a fly can be such a pest -- you move your hand to make it move away or try to swat it with your hand -- but cant quite get it.
