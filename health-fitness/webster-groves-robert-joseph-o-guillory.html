  <title>Webster Groves - Robert Joseph O’Guillory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Webster Groves, a suburb on the outskirts of St. Louis, Missouri seemed like a great place to live in the 1960s. Awash in postcard-perfect homes and tree-lined streets, the residents must be happy, right?&lt;p&gt; 
But thats not the case for Bobby, who first tries running away from home at age five, only to realize that he has no choice but to endure brutal beatings from his father and mother. Even then, he knows that his parents are psychopaths and that his only hope for a normal life is to escape.&lt;p&gt; 
Its not until Bobby is in his mid-thirties, shopping for the best gun to commit suicide that he realizes that he has problems, and they dont stop at the tumor growing in his groin or his recent divorce. They go straight back to his childhood.&lt;p&gt; 
Join Bobby as he deals with problems shared by many baby boomers and children of suburbia. If hes strong, or just crazy enough, he may just be able to get past the darkest memories from Webster Groves." />
