  <title>The Marriage Manual - Ainsley H. Duff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rationale for the book.
Marriage is under serious attack from the forces of evil. There is much deception in the world and, sad to say, this deception is coming even from the pulpit. The idea that God does not want you to suffer and will understand your decision to divorce your spouse is not scriptural and can have eternal consequences for those who do this. If you do not forgive that spouse you are about to divorce, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your decision to divorce.  Even if you have already been divorced and remarried, forgiving those who hurt you is a prerequisite for receiving forgiveness from God, for your sins. 
God has given clear instructions, in His Word, about marriage and what he expects from such a union. But, what has happened is that we have taken Gods Grace and Mercy as excuses to create a God who sits in Heaven just handing out forgiveness and blessings to us as we continually live in disobedience to His word, while at the same time expecting Him to pour out financial and other rewards to us. God used the prophet, Hosea, to demonstrate to us that He hurts as we go a whoring from Him after our gods, whether in the form of wealth, sex or any of the many other gods we place before Him. Dont forget that another name for Jehovah is Jealous and He is a jealous God.
This book seeks to look at marriage from the aspect of Gods directions to us as stated in the Bible. It also takes a look at some of the marriages of biblical figures such as Adam and Eve, Joseph and Mary, King David and his wives, King Ahab and Jezebel among others. Men and women are different in all their aspects and this must be taken into consideration as they make that decision to walk lifes path together as husband and wife, as God in His wisdom has laid out clear instructions to us with regards to our roles in this union. He is clear on children and how they should be brought up as well as how they should relate to their parents in the family. The roles of the father and of the mother are clearly outlined as well as when the dissolution of union through divorce is allowed by God. It is hoped that marriages will benefit as a result of the contents found between the covers of THE MARRIAGE MANUAL." />
