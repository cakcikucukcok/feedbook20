  <title>The Pledge of a Lifetime - Mark T. Oelze Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is it about conflict that causes all of us to shy away? Why is it so difficult? What if there was a step-by-step process to guide us through conflict and create a deeper connection at the same time? And what if the principles learned could enhance all communication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Pledge of a Lifetime, follow Jake and Lisas story and discover how to transform tense confrontations into rich conversations. Watch family dynamics improve as everyone works together to communicate in a manner governed by love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his years of conflict resolving experiences, Mark Oelze leads you into the counselors office between the covers of this book, where you will learn the keys to process any conflict, big or small. Fear no longer has to hold you back. Work the PLEDGE to build strong healthy communication with love as your highest goal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark is a gifted counselor, speaker and teacher. Perhaps his most important teaching is the PLEDGE messagea tool to resolve conflict and enhance all relationships. I highly recommend Mark and his book, The Pledge of a Lifetime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Canfield, PhD, founder of the National Center for Fathering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark delivers a great story with the added bonus of practical and life-giving principles to revolutionize the way couples communicatethrough a heart of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jo Lynn Bright, LCMFT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. I cried. I lamented my own failings. And I left longing for deeper connection with my wife and kids. Thanks, Mark!&lt;/p&gt;
