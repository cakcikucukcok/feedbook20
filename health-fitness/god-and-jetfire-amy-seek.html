  <title>God and Jetfire - Amy Seek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A searching, eloquent memoir about the joys and hardships of open adoption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;God and Jetfire&lt;/i&gt; is a mother&#39;s account of her decision to surrender her son in an open adoption and of their relationship over the twelve years that follow. Facing an unplanned pregnancy at twenty-two, Amy Seek and her ex-boyfriend begin an exhaustive search for a family to raise their child. They sift through hundreds of &quot;Dear Birth Mother&quot; letters, craft an extensive questionnaire, and interview numerous potential couples. Despite the immutability of the surrender, it does little to diminish Seek&#39;s newfound feelings of motherhood. Once an ambitious architecture student, she struggles to reconcile her sadness with the hope that she&#39;s done the best for her son, a struggle complicated by her continued, active presence in his life.&lt;br&gt;     For decades, closed adoptions were commonplace. Now, new laws are guaranteeing adoptees&#39; access to birth records, and open adoption is on the rise. &lt;i&gt;God and Jetfire&lt;/i&gt; is the rare memoir that explores the intricate dynamics and exceptional commitment of an open-adoption relationship from the perspective of a birth mother searching for her place within it.&lt;br&gt;     Written with literary poise and distinction, &lt;i&gt;God and Jetfire&lt;/i&gt; is a story of a life divided between grief and gratitude, regret and joy. It is an elegy for a lost motherhood, a celebration of a family gained, and an apology to a beloved son.&lt;/p&gt;" />
