  <title>Freedom from Yourself - Alexander King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Freedom from Yourself: Selected Poems from Divan Shams Tabrizi&lt;/i&gt; is a guide written to help set us free from our ignorance and the prison of our minds which keeps us occupied in misery, fear, and guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumis teaching is based on the foundations of Sufifism which is divine love, worship, simplicity and moderation, goodness, consciousness of God, humbleness, and tolerance. The most celebrated relationship in Rumis spiritual development was with Shams Tabrizi, whom he met in Konya. Through their spiritual teamwork, they enlightened many people and also influenced all the centuries which followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide was written to help people reach their ultimate goal of attaining Nirvanaa state of mind when all our desires subside and we live in total harmony, peace, serenity and total stillness of the mind. it represents the final goal of Buddhism. &lt;i&gt;Freedom from Yourself&lt;/i&gt; enables everyone to go deeper into the meaning of Shams Tabrizis poems and to apply them directly to the everyday problems we can encounter. &lt;/p&gt;" />
