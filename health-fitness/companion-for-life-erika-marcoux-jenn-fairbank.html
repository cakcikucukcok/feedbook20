  <title>Companion for Life - Erika Marcoux, Jenn Fairbank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are so excited for you and the journey that you are about to embark upon in this book Companion for Life: The Foundations for Living. The Cornerstone: Mindfulness for Life program is comprehensive on every level and will guide you to self-empowerment. In reading this book, you will remember how to properly care for and understand your body. You will remember how to work with your emotions in the most intelligent of ways. You will remember your true work and purpose. You will remember awareness, which is beyond your limited thoughts, and ultimately embrace your true self with complete consciousness and compassion. 
The goal of this book is to help you be a fully alive human being and remember to be true to yourself in daily life by being mindful. Meditation is the key. Every aspect of your life, including your body, emotion, behavior, and mind, is important and dependent upon each other. Your individual personality is meaningful and essential. Your personality is always present in daily life. It is the thread that pulls the different elements of your life together and gives it cohesion. 
Life is always changing and your true self is the still point from which your life revolves. This still point is bigger than and holds your personality. Your true self is constant and your body, emotion, behavior, and thought are constantly changing. Conscious compassion is that still point (your foundation), your companion for life. Your true self is conscious compassion. It is the deepest part of you that never changes and is infinitely wise and loving. It is the part of you that inherently knows without thinking and is connected to everything. 
Meditation is the way to connect to conscious compassion. Compassion is love and consciousness is being aware of that love. This book is a reminder of everything you already know, its all inside of you. Are you ready? Lets get started." />
