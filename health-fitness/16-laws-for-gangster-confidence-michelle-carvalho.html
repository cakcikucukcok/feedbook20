  <title>16 Laws for Gangster Confidence - Michelle Carvalho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Without confidence we stay in relationships that hurt us. We offer up years of our lives to jobs that leave us feeling deprived, and we sacrifice our own needs to please others. We feel helpless and without the direction we need to change our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is packed with the powerful insight and truth that is born from authentic experience. It offers an in-depth description of the principal offenses working against a healthy level of self-confidence. From personal experiences with abuse, family trauma, ugly duckling syndrome, and low self-esteem I have drawn out the solutions for restoring your confidence and organized them into sixteen laws. Each law represents an integral part of the life experience, whether with a cheating and lying partner, or an unappreciative employer, the daily assaults breaking your down confidence are exposed. Together the Laws combine into the strategies that have been collated over years of psychology, science, anatomy, metaphysics, and sharp street wisdom to help you achieve the highest level of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 16 Laws are geared to shift your spirit, raise your awareness, and unleash the fucks you need to do the things you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
