  <title>Unhinged - Anna Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite all her best efforts to break the cycle of catastrophic, destructive patterns of mental illness, Anna Berry found herself at the end of her rope----unemployed, penniless, homeless, and in the throes of a psychotic episode that threatened to destroy her life. Alone and unwell, she manages to find her grip on life, seeks the help she needs, and embarks on a life and career that illustrate that mental illness does not have to be ruinous. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Unhinged: A Memoir of Enduring, Surviving, and Overcoming Family Mental Illness &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a powerful memoir that chronicles Berry&amp;rsquo;s life as both a casualty and survivor of family mental illness. From her point of rock-bottom to her own recovery, as well as her efforts to help her still-afflicted mother and brother find hope and healing, we see how she struggles to recognize her own illness while coping with the fallout from her family&amp;rsquo;s other victims. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In telling her story, Berry uncovers the difficulties inherent in not only growing up with mental illness among family members, but also the frustrations of not being able to recognize or handle the trajectory of her own illness. Yet, after successfully finding methods of treating her symptoms, Berry goes on to become a successful journalist and author, who now helps educate the public about mental health through her writing, while also serving as her mother&amp;rsquo;s court-appointed legal guardian. This story shows the devastating impact of mental illness on whole families, but offers readers a message of hope and healing. Berry&amp;rsquo;s story is sure to resonate with the many people who deal with the mental illness of family members, and their own struggles to cope with their own diagnoses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
