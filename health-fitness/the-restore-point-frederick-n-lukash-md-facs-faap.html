  <title>The Restore Point - Frederick N. Lukash Md Facs Faap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;OBESITY IS THE NUMBER ONE HEALTH CHALLENGE FOR KIDS AND TEENS TODAY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children and teens are battling weight issues from alarmingly early ages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese kids and teens face risk factors like cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol and high blood pressure and are more likely to develop pre-diabetes. They are also more likely to suffer from social and psychological issues like bullying and low self-esteem. You may have tried and failed to help your child lose weight on fad diets and extreme exercise programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to realize is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUR CHILD WAS NOT BORN TO BE FAT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU CAN RESTORE YOUR CHILD&#39;S METABOLISM TO A LIFETIME OF LEAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like personal computers, our bodies are at risk for taking on the malware of processed foods, bad eating habits and increasingly sedentary &quot;virtual&quot; lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE RESTORE POINT is a metabolic &quot;fix&quot;that turns back your child or teen&#39;s body to its original, healthy &quot;factory fresh&quot;version. THE RESTORE POINT was written by Frederick N. Lukash, a pediatric plastic surgeon who deals with the aftermath of childhood obesity everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In THE RESTORE POINT, Dr. Lukash shows you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to create a lifetime template of healthy eating habits based on THE FOOD WHEEL vs. the old fashioned Food Pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to get your child moving with simple, inexpensive techniques that prepare the body for increasingly dynamic levels of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How eating evolved to make kids fat. Your child&#39;s obesity is NOT YOUR FAULT. Helicopter parents and tiger moms have fat kids, too. The solution is to go back to our original, evolutionary RESTORE POINT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book of simple principles is designed specifically for overweight kids, teens and their families. Its easy-to-follow, basic guidelines have already helped kids and teens lose hundreds of pounds, healthfully and forever, preparing them for STRONG, LEAN LIVING for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
