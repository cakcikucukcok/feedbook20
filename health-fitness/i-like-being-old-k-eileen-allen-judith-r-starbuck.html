  <title>I Like Being Old - K. Eileen Allen, Judith R. Starbuck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eileen Allen is a seeker. In her nineties, still with a smile on her face, she is trying new things, looking forward, and making choices that provide her with the best life possibleeven despite losses in her vision, hearing, and mobility. &lt;i&gt;I Like Being Old&lt;/i&gt; provides inspiration for millions of baby boomers ready to take control of their choices and begin believing that old age can be rewarding, fun, and a time to stay open to all life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an honest, self-disclosing style, Eileen shares how she has faced such important aging decisions as relinquishing driving, moving to a retirement center, staying fit and involved, and adjusting to decreasing independence. She encourages other senior citizens to find satisfaction in solving problems that accompany aging, as she describes how she has enriched her own life by discovering simple pleasures, maintaining vital ties with family and friends, choosing to be happy, and living fully until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eileen Allen likes being old. By sharing her remarkable life experiences, she encourages anyone in the midst of aging to savor each day, pay attention to little details, and discover a whole new appreciation for life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
