  <title>Fibromyalgia: An Essential Guide for Patients and Their Families - Daniel J. Wallace, J. B. Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fibromyalgia is a form of chronic neuromuscular pain, a pain-amplification syndrome brought on by abnormal interactions between hormones, the immune system, neurotransmitters, and the autonomic nervous system, that afflicts six million Americans every year. Often misdiagnosed, and widely misunderstood, the majority of patients are turned away from doctors or treated for depression. This guide offers expert advice to sufferers of this painful syndrome and gives them the education they need to get the help they require but rarely get.  In their earlier books, Making Sense of Fibromyalgia and All About Fibromyalgia, noted medical writer Janice Wallace and Dr. Daniel Wallace, a leading expert on this disorder, provided comprehensive guides--for both patients and professionals--to this little known and poorly understood syndrome. Now, in Fibromyalgia, the Wallaces provide an inviting and succinct version of the syndrome they have studied, laid out in clear and accessible language. The authors provide a clear, concise explanation of the syndrome and its symptoms, and also outline the recent advances in treatments.  Fibromyalgia addresses a desperate need for concise, accessible information on this syndrome and offers reassurance to patients and their families." />
