  <title>Grains of Discipline - Hannah Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to William. S. Cottringer, discipline is the focused attitude of self-control that drives the systematic and consistent application of blood, sweat, and tears to get results. Discipline is the epitome of enduring, intrinsic motivation that overcomes the constant adversity that confronts us all on a daily basis. Success doesnt make discipline, but discipline enhances success. Accepting total responsibility of ourselves in situations and exercising self-restraint in attempt to get to our destination is what makes a man said to be discipline. We also must be successful in discovering important truths that can help us reach our goals, as well as avoiding the natural inclination to get lopsided or out of balance, which just requires more discipline to correct. Accepting the grains of discipline is merely a matter of stopping your talk and starting your walk. Talk only delays your working step and prolongs your journey.
Discipline is said to have taken place when your deed is done in accordance to posterity and consciousness. The grains of discipline are the instructions/guidelines of discipline as an acronym, as a word, as a movement and actualization. It tells the attribute of a man in his nature.
Discipline is neither a religious act nor cultural practices but a pure way of life to a peaceful living. It takes discipline to be religious and cultural, but it doesnt take religion or culture to be discipline." />
