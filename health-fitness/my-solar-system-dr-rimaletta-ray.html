  <title>My Solar System! - Dr. Rimaletta Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Be the Station for Your Inspiration!
Life has a different quality depending on the state of our consciousness.  Transformation of emotions into a constructive, not destructive force is our main goal on this path. .So, we suggest you instill in your consciousness individualized rhyming boosters, or intelligence boosters that modify the inner I-Language(Noam Chomsky), making it more motivational, inspirational, and electrifying and thus affecting your emotional intelligence. We are all suggestible to some degree and if we tend to self-suggest love, confidence, kindness, and compassion, we can uplift the spirit and do much more to ourselves than any most well-wishing therapist. The inspirational value of language is an accepted fact. When used auto-suggestively, language power doubles because it helps rediscover the power of words, on the one hand, and it conveys a lot of energy to us, on the other. Our rhyming boosters energize the computational system of the mind thanks to the rhythm that is increased by the words that break at the end of the lines in a rap-like way. Each booster is based on an auto-suggestive concept that is developed in an essay structure - Introduction, Body, and Conclusion, helping to better adopt pieces of wisdom that they communicate.
