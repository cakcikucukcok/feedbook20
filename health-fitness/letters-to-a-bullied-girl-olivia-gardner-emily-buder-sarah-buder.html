  <title>Letters to a Bullied Girl - Olivia Gardner, Emily Buder, Sarah Buder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Olivia Gardner, a northern California teenager, was severely taunted and cyber-bullied by her classmates for more than two years. News of her bullying spread, eventually reaching two teenage girls from a neighboring town, sisters Emily and Sarah Buder. The girls were so moved by Olivia&#39;s story that they initiated a letter-writing campaign to help lift her spirits. It was a tender gesture of solidarity that set off an overwhelming chain reaction of support, encouragement, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Letters to a Bullied Girl&lt;/em&gt;, Olivia and the Buder sisters share an inspiring selection of messages that arrived from across America&amp;#8212;the personal, often painful remembrances of former targets, remorseful bullies, and sympathetic bystanders. &lt;em&gt;Letters to a Bullied Girl&lt;/em&gt; examines our national bullying epidemic from a variety of angles and perspectives, and includes practical guidance from bullying expert Barbara Coloroso, author of &lt;em&gt;The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander&lt;/em&gt;. Though addressed to Olivia, the letters speak to all young people who have been bullied, offer advice and hope to those who suffer, and provide a wake-up call to all who have ever been involved in bullying.&lt;/p&gt;" />
