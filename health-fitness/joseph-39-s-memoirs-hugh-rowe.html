  <title>Joseph&#39;s Memoirs - Hugh Rowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joseph was born a prince, but his brothers, who hated him for his dreams and his values, sold him into slavery in Egypt. Bought by Potiphar, captain of the kings guards, he was quickly made the head of the household, only to be sent to prison for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. Once more he stood out, and he was made assistant to the warden. One dream and lessons passed down to his children by his grandfather Abraham led to his promotion from slave to the second-highest position in Egypt. These lessons saved not just one man from the depths of prison but the entire world from a deep recession. Join Joseph as he tells you what made him successful personally as he took a nation through one of its worst periods of recession." />
