  <title>We Bleed - Zuzu Alexi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I reflect on the many routes I travelled and I see the variety of landscapes my eyes beheld. I think of the many slopes and the stale hills. I walked through valleys and rivers, big and small. I remember the great few mountains I gazed upon and the trees young, old, and tall. I walked different trails and opened my eyes in different places.
I had seen grass dancing with the breeze and a clear blue sky. I remember a sunset waving to say goodnight and a moon trying to outshine the stars. I remember lying under the shade of a tree, watching a worm crawling on its stump. I have seen ants going about their business and insects great and small. I strolled between weeds and shrubs and played with their stems. As for my body, it knows how it feels to lie on meadows. I walked on sand and felt the tiny stones between my toes. Some late afternoons I heard birds singing with operatic voices. As a child I played in the rain and heard the thunder above my head. After the rain I saw the promise of God in the skya rainbow. Ive watched the flow if a stream breaking on pebbles, and when I gazed up to the sky I saw clouds moving by. I already heard the wind in its fury and witnessed the ocean in its rage. I have seen a desert storm and hid my face from its rusty desert sand.
I have seen flowers bloom and bees buzzing for their nectar. I know how to greet every new day with my prayers and give gratitude to the Creator for the creation. My journey is the recorded history of my time and in my time. I have seen what I have seen and know in my heart that life is a special gift. But I have also seen despair and troubled times. I had many encounters with dark days, but I rose from the pain. I have tasted my tears and seen my own blood. Every day I see my reflection in the mirror, then I remind myself that I am more than what I see. I go through bad times and also through good times. I sometimes fight fear, doubt, and tears, but I stand for the human race because it is my passion. 
I have seen human tears, emotional pain, and human fears. Therefore, within me there is a warrior that knows how to bleed and survive. Each day I learn to cope with the pressures of life, and I never give up on a grain of hope. I breathe, I laugh, I cry, but I am here and I exist. I was in my yesterday and will be in my tomorrow. At this moment I am now. I am the sentinel of my life and with my voice I announce that I am who I am and I am here with you on the same planet called Earth. Now you know who I am; I am mortal flesh." />
