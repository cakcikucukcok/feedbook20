  <title>The Solution to Your Success - Rok Zolnir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout this book, I want to make you realize that life is beautiful you just need to find or create the solution to succeed in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its going to take you through different aspects of success, whether is that in your personal life, family life or business/work life and will lead you to put them on the right track, by giving you a skill to recognize your visions, set up your goals and the ability to achieve them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it will teach you how to continously live your life successfully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly to achieve your success, you will need to connect two main domains of the success with four different stages, which I talk about throughout this book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four stages are:&lt;/br&gt;
 Stage 1: Open your eyes and start living your beautiful life&lt;/br&gt;
 Stage 2: Transmit your destiny&lt;/br&gt;
 Stage 3: Control your mind and wisdom&lt;/br&gt;
 Stage 4: Keep moving forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I challenge you to stay focused and forget about the problems. This is the key to becoming successful with this book, as it is not concerned with talking about problems, but rather focused on creating and finding solutions. &lt;/p&gt;" />
