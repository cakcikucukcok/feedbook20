After chasing her kids around the yard, she became so winded that she couldnt keep up with them. This is where you start to go downhill, Debbie, her uncle told her.
Im only twenty-six years old, she replied.
On the way home, she took a closer look at her lifestyle. She realized she was watching too much television, drinking too much soda, and smoking way too many cigarettes.
The next day, she woke up at 5:30 a.m. and thought, This is it. From that day on, she began devoting herself to physical fitness.
She made her mission a family affair, teaching her children, Jeff, Alynna, and Jon, how to stay in shape. In short order, they were scouting the aisles at the grocery store for something heavylifting milk cartons over their heads and squatting ten-pound potato sacks.
Crall would go on to become a certified personal trainer, fitness model, public speaker, and competitive bodybuilder. Join her on an inspirational journey, and take baby steps to improving your nutrition, physical fitness, and body image with the lessons in Go Ask Debbie." />
