  <title>Living in Light, Love &amp; Truth - Kasi Kaye Iliopoulos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Awarded a 2015 Living Now Evergreen Bronze Medal Book Award for Spiritual Leadership
&lt;p&gt;You Can Change Your Life by Living in Light, Love &amp; TruthAwareness + Reflection + Learning + Application = Wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living in Light, Love &amp; Truth&lt;/i&gt; provides insight in how to balance the spiritual (inner) and physical (outer) aspects of ourselves as an individual and in the life we live. It breaks down life events, and it attempts to identify the ego by examining truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living in Light, Love &amp; Truth&lt;/i&gt; explores topics such as our life purpose, the ego, energy, free will, intuition and gratitude. It also offers the opportunity to reflect, understand and cleanse fear-based energies that inhibit you from holistically experiencing an empowering and positive life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you on your life journey, each chapter is accompanied with reflective quotes, reflection exercises and affirmations, which form part of the self-healing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living in Light, Love &amp; Truth&lt;/i&gt; is the first layer of life transformation: taking responsibility for actions, emotions, feelings, thoughts, words and perceptions towards ourselves, others, situations and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge without application is simply knowledge. Applying the knowledge to ones life is wisdomand that is the ultimate virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age, Kasi Kaye Iliopoulos has known a great compassion for life. Her passion to discover the spiritual laws of life has always inspired her. Undertaking energy healing practitioner training steered her towards healing herself and others, and living her life purpose. She currently lives in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
