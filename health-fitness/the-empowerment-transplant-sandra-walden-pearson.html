  <title>The Empowerment Transplant - Sandra Walden Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Victims of workplace bullying may feel theyve lost control both of their professional future, their emotions, and their behavior on a day-to-day basis. They want to get their lives back but often dont know where to start. theempowerment transplant offers a way to do just that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This DIY handbook acts as both a source of comfort and a practical, easy way for victims of bullying to reclaim their lives after their self-determination and empowerment have become the first casualties in their workplace war. This guide outlines the process of mindful proactivity, which can help derail the instinctual fightor-flight reaction that most of us feel when threatened. Using a structured depersonalising strategy, you can emerge stronger from the past experience of bullying and intimidation and be better prepared to prevent its impact into the future. You can also gain self-aware leadership in your own life and change your life for the better, permanently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This self-help guide helps victims of workplace bullying transplant their learned empowerment into situations of perceived threat, reclaiming their self-determination and personal strength. &lt;/p&gt;" />
