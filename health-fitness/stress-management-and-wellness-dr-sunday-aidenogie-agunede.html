  <title>Stress Management and Wellness - Dr. Sunday Aidenogie Agunede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stress is a part of our everyday life. It is a very cheap commodity that is easily bought by both the rich and the poor. Today it is a problem of the chief executives and the poor market woman. 
To our early men it was all about the fear of harmful wild animals in the forest; but as civilization increases there is also increase in life demands and issues that could cause stress, hence the need to be equip with the tools to cope with it. 
The need for the knowledge on stress management can never be over emphasized if we realize that stress could go a long way to adversely affect our individual productivity vis--vis our National productivity and development. 
Quote: 
Philosophy is always trying to reach that state of mind where all mistakes can stand corrected and to exercise that unprejudiced, large and perceptive affection for the world, that openness of reason, which can tolerate what is real and true and when no decisive answer is possible, can endure doubt and which always remain ready to communicate and prevent the rigidity of fixed opinion 
Karl Jaspers 
This book is a must- read for everyone who has the need to fight stress in any way. The application of the fighting strategies cuts across the poor, the rich, the employers and the employees. Everyone can use the knowledge acquired in this book to empower himself in the fight against stress. The book should therefore find a place in the shelves of all those who want to be progressive in life, as it is known that the road to progress is full of stress." />
