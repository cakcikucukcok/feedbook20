  <title>Ganja Yoga - Dee Dussault, Georgia Bardi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the first yoga instructor to bring cannabis-enhanced yoga classes to North America, a groundbreaking guide to finding balance in our lives using the ancient method of mixing cannabis with spiritual practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogis have been using cannabis to enhance spiritual practice for millennia. Today, there is a quiet but growing conversation within the Western yoga community about the potential role of cannabis for modern seekers pursuing a spiritual path. Now, certified yoga instructor Dee Dussault takes this ancient practice mainstream. &lt;em&gt;Ganja Yoga&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t just mixing cannabis and exercise; it is a ceremony that makes conscious relaxation an intentional ritual that can be enhanced with practice&amp;#8212;a lifestyle to help you create a more harmonious and stress-free world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some contemporary yoga adherents, marijuana can deepen awareness, acceptance, connection, and relaxation during practice. As state laws loosen and the stigma surrounding marijuana dissipates, cannabis is increasingly seen as a legitimate supplement to increased health and wellbeing. &lt;em&gt;Ganja Yoga&lt;/em&gt; explains how to set up a sacred space that allows you to use this relaxing substance with yoga for enlightenment (or at least some awesome stretching and meditation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee walks you through the considerations and best practices for introducing cannabis into your yoga practice, or infusing yoga into your smoking routine. But it&amp;#8217;s not about being stoned out of your head&amp;#8212;as Dee says, it&amp;#8217;s like adding spice to your food. In &lt;em&gt;Ganja Yoga&lt;/em&gt;, she explains how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reap the benefits of profound relaxation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assume an altered state in a safe, energizing way&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deepen the spiritual practice of yoga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reconnect with the body using ancient techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select the best setting, time, method of consumption, strains, poses, and breathing techniques to ensure an excellent experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to practice in a class or in the privacy of your own home, &lt;em&gt;Ganja Yoga&lt;/em&gt; is your key to reaching a new spiritual high.&lt;/p&gt;" />
