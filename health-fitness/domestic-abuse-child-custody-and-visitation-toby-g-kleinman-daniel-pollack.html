  <title>Domestic Abuse, Child Custody, and Visitation - Toby G. Kleinman, Daniel Pollack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When domestic abuse and children are involved, divorce and custody can be the epitome of high-stakes conflict and frustration and all too frequently protective parents lose custody of their child to a named abuser. &lt;em&gt;Domestic Abuse, Child Custody, and Visitation&lt;/em&gt; helps mental health professionals, attorneys, and lay readers navigate the judicial process so that decisions are truly made in the best interest of children. The text reveals how all the puzzle pieces of the judicial process fit together -- judges, attorneys, mental health experts, children, spouses -- and how to overcome many of the obstacles they will confront along the way. This runs the gamut, from the selelection of a lawyer and experts, to setting necessary groundwork for an appeal. &lt;em&gt;Domestic Abuse, Child Custody, and Visitation &lt;/em&gt;is an essential read for mental health professionals and lay people involved in divorce and custody, family court judges, family law attorneys, and mental health professionals involved in domestic abuse and custody matters." />
