  <title>Vigilance - Joseph Mayberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one expects to be the victim of crime and violence, however these situations occur everyday and generally without advance warning. In our current society, criminals are becoming educated and terrorists are becoming bolder and wiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to stay ahead of the game, it is vital for the average citizen to learn how to recognize the signs and signals of impending danger. By utilizing this inherent knowledge, anyone can prevent the crimes from happening and the criminal from succeeding in obtaining what they want. To do this, we must change the way we think about how a criminal operates. But even more important, we must understand ourselves and how to mentally prepare for what could be the worst day of our life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advanced guide will teach you the skills and techniques to help keep you and your loved ones safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You walk onto a parking lot and get a feeling that something is not right.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You are sitting at work and get a sense that something bad is about to occur.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;While walking down the street, you get a feeling that you are being followed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vigilance is the preemptive knowledge and instinct applied before something bad happens. Everyone has it. Very few use it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
