  <title>From Barefoot to Stilettos, It&#39;s Not for Sissies - Marie Pizano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The answer no is unacceptable to Marie Pizano in her quest of life. In her memoir, From Barefoot to Stilettos,she tells the story of her life thus far. She vividly recounts her experiences from childhood days, living on food stamps, learning the ways of local gangs, and double-dutching on the streets of south-side Chicago. Brilliantly, she shares the inspirational tale of her survival of a life-changing motorcycle accident and her perseverance to keep moving forward despite the odds she faced. She reveals, in complete honesty, the feelings and struggles she faced when she moved to Memphis to live as a trophy-wife life  dealing with everything from the mean girls, the monster-in-law, and the panic attacks, to becoming a mother, her post-divorce years, and defeating the odds by building an entertainment powerhouse  all while rediscovering herself, her life, and her power. Through explorations of her own past, present, and potential future, Marie reflects on how the sum of her trials and triumphs have shaped her into the empowered woman she has become in her incessant quest to find her yes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is a powerful message here for other women  or anyone, for that matter in situations that are less than ideal; you can always find your yes, no matter what happens in your life. You can survive! You have a choice  you can either play the victim, or you can do something about it; even when you are at your absolute lowest, there is still a flicker of light that can ignite you. You can stand tall again and walk proudly in your stilettos with truth and integrity; sometimes, you just have to fight for it  life is not for sissies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
