  <title>Parent&#39;s Guide to Coping with Autism - Sarah Ziegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an essential guide for parents and carers coping with children with autism. When Sarah Ziegel&#39;s twin boys were diagnosed with autism, aged almost three, she realized that there was very little practical information about what to do. When her next two children were also diagnosed with the condition, she was even more determined to put that lack of information right. This book is the result of Sarah&#39;s experiences of dealing with autism in the family. While covering personal aspects such as coping emotionally with a diagnosis, the book also tackles practical matters, such as education and the EHCP process, how to get help and support, and also considers the medical side of autism. Written by a former nurse, and full-time mother and carer, A Parent&#39;s Guide to Coping with Autism is a highly sensitive and professional guide and is the book you will want to reach for when faced with a diagnosis, or if you simply want to find out more about the condition." />
