  <title>Born for a Reason - Carolee Johnson Mh Nd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You can achieve your highest goals in health and abundance. When you become free of any thought that limits you, then you are unlimited in your ability to create your vision. And since we were all born to create, this leads to the highest levels of peace, joy, and fulfilment.
In Born for a Reason, Dr. Carolee Johnson delivers a powerful message and action plan to help you break through every limiting belief you have experienced and discover your divine purpose. Through muscle testing, you can pinpoint the deepest core beliefs that hold you back from finding that purpose and achieving everything you have ever dreamed of. Johnson shares the secrets of the Quantum Techniques trauma code, a powerful tool for releasing trauma and phobias from your body. She then presents seven laws learned from a variety of sources designed to aid you in learning that your higher sacred self is capable of anything.
This guide offers techniques and advice that serve as stepping-stones toward freeing you from whatever holds you back and understanding and embracing your divine purpose." />
