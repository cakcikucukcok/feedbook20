  <title>Lose Weight by Eating: Detox Week - Audrey Johns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lose 10 pounds in 7 days&amp;#8212;the author of the popular book and blog&lt;em&gt; Lose Weight by Eating&lt;/em&gt; offers multiple plan options and 130 delicious, real-food recipes in this illustrated guide to help you get healthy, eat better, and reach (and maintain) your ideal weight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary detoxes shouldn&amp;#8217;t leave you hungry, deprived, and desperate to binge on the foods you&amp;#8217;ve been trying to avoid. Instead, Audrey Johns has designed a practical, proven detox plan that encourages you to eat for your cravings. She took naughty recipes and made them over so nice that they&amp;#8217;re actually healthier than fancy juice cleanses. She knows the plan works because fans of her website who have followed it have lost impressive amounts of weight&amp;#8212;some up to eighteen pounds in a single week!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Audrey expands her popular online plan, turning it into a customizable program that accelerates weight loss and raises metabolism naturally. With &lt;em&gt;Lose Weight by Eating: Detox Week&lt;/em&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll abstain from any food or drink that isn&amp;#8217;t natural, replace fried foods with baked, minimize sugars, substitute carbohydrates with healthier versions, and indulge with festive mocktails instead of alcohol. By filling your diet with food that actually aids the body in dumping toxins, that unwanted fat will begin to melt away and you&amp;#8217;ll feel healthier, stronger, and more energetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lose Weight by Eating: Detox Week&lt;/em&gt; is not a fast. It&amp;#8217;s a chance to reset your relationship with food and shed pounds without feeling deprived. Audrey lays out 4 plans and provides a Detox Quiz to determine which one is best for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detox Diet Week: lose an average of 10 pounds with the original 7-day plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detox Diet Month: a 30-day plan that can get rid of those stubborn 10 to 25 pounds you&amp;#8217;ve been trying to lose for years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 3-Month Detox Plan: drop weight fast&amp;#8212;up to 50 pounds in 90 days!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Detox Lifestyle: a 365-day plan that is ideal for all ages and stages of life&amp;#8212;and a great way to maintain your current weight after weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the plans work together so you can follow one and work up to another, and each includes exercise goals and recommendations for daily sleep and hydration. Best of all, you&amp;#8217;ll get to treat yourself to fabulous food! Audrey includes dozens of recipes, many fast and easy enough to make any day of the week&amp;#8212;and all under 500 calories per meal&amp;#8212;including Pineapple Mango Green Sorbet, English Muffin Sandwiches with Homemade Sausage Patties, Ceviche Tostadas with Homemade Salsa and Guacamole, Chili Casserole with Cornbread Topping, Avocado Club Cheeseburgers, Chocolate Dipped Key Lime Popsicles, Mango Cucumber Basil Detox Water, and other delicious crave-worthy delights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lose Weight by Eating: Detox Week&lt;/em&gt; comes complete with tips and tricks for motivation and ease, success stories from real people who have shed the pounds, and handy shopping lists and meal planners so you can you stay on track to achieve and maintain your goals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
