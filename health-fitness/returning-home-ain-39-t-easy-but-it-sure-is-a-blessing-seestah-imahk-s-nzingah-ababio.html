  <title>Returning Home Ain&#39;t Easy but It Sure Is a Blessing - Seestah ImahkÜS Nzingah Ababio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Returning Home Aint Easy But it Sure Is A Blessing is  a very moving and penetrating work that every African whether he or she intends on repatriating to Africa or not, should read.  It is an invaluable guide to all Africans who are desperately trying to make their way back home.  
To re-locate is not a simple matter.  It requires a determination to succeed, a firm faith in God the Almighty and patience to learn and re-learn.   The power of this book prepares a plan for those wanting to return home to re-acquaint themselves with the land of their Afrikan ancestors. 
This book shows wisdom, extreme sensibility, and sense of humor necessary to help one to re-settle and make their home in Ghana or anywhere in Africa for that matter.  
The discourse also includes Ghanaian law as it relates to the subject of Dual Citizenship and The Right of Abode for Afrikans born in the Diaspora.  
This book can help those who may choose to walk the path of Return, but should also be read by those who do not intend to re-locate as it is a book, which imparts valuable information about a country in Africa, one of the countries that many African-Americans repatriate toGhana.  Her straightforward choice of words makes for an admirable, enjoyable, serious and commendable read." />
