  <title>Countdown to Greatness - Michael  Carter Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Countdown to Greatness&amp;quot; &amp;quot;(C2G)&amp;quot; is designed to ignite and re-ignite an individual&amp;#39;s awareness of their potential. The book reminds us that all individuals have greatness within them, and that we all have the ability to make a positive difference in the lives of others. By helping others, we help ourselves to become better individuals, and move closer and closer to our own potential and to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we understand the internal emotional reward of helping others, we begin to see not only our potential as individuals, but also see our potential as members of a family, a team, or a group of individuals working together for a common purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C2G provides basic principles of individual development, presented in a condensed and easy-to understand format. Individuals of all ages can take the information and apply it in their daily lives. Readers can continuously look to C2G to remind them of their purpose, so they can find the key to their self-inspiration. Once we find our internal fire, we will always know how to rediscover our fire, and re-ignite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote C2G to make a positive difference in the lives of others. I was inspired to write this book as a tribute to all those who have inspired me throughout my career and my life. My hope is that Countdown to Greatness will ignite that same type of inspiration in everyone that reads this book. And if reading this book inspires you, then you have inspired me even more, as inspiration is a continuous cycle. We all have greatness within us. It is up to us to find it and share it with all those around us. Time to Inspire! Time to Be Great!&lt;/p&gt;" />
