      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a phenomenon going on right now in American like no other time in history. It seems as if not even a few hours goes by, let alone a day, whereby the average teens does not click a button to accept or send a friend me request on Facebook, or to send or receive a tweet on Twitter, or to quickly craft one of the 3600 text messages sent out each month on average by todays youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teens are flocking in droves to be liked or to be followed and to feel as if they fit in and are part of something special. They are willing to, in essence, bare it all on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are willing to share who they are, where they live, their personal contact information, what they like to do, where they like to go, what their hobbies are, intimate thoughts about their personalities, what music or movies they like, things going on in their lives daily or in some cases hourly, and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
