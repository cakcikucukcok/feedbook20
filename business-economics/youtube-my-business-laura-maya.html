YouTube can change your marketing game. It might take your brand off the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
YouTube is not only the second largest search engine besides Google, but it&amp;rsquo;s rivalling Facebook as the largest social media platform ever &amp;ndash; making advertising on YouTube more appealing than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;
Hence, it is important that you understand how the platform is evolving this year as well as the video marketing strategies.&lt;br /&gt;
From a business perspective, it&amp;#39;s hard to deny the effectiveness of video marketing. Businesses of all sizes can adopt a video marketing strategy as part of their inbound marketing strategy.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s no wonder why 81% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, which is up from 63% the year prior, according to last year&amp;rsquo;s Wyzowl&amp;#39;s State of Video Marketing survey.&lt;br /&gt;
If you think that was impressive, wait until you hear this:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ranked first over Netflix, Facebook, and Hulu, which got 29%, 10%, and 7% of votes, respectively. YouTube isn&amp;rsquo;t just the favourite; it&amp;rsquo;s more popular than the other three networks combined&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;YouTube has more than 50 million content creators churning out videos regularly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;180 million hours of video content is consumed there every day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s no denying that YouTube has a massive potential audience with every video that goes live on this platform. And with this year just beginning to unfold, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the best opportunity for you to go viral with your channel.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, We have put together all the resources you need to tap into this incredible marketing potential.&lt;br /&gt;
This guide is your go-to resource where you&amp;rsquo;re going to learn how to make money from YouTube, video advertising, designing a robust YouTube&amp;nbsp; marketing strategy, the latest YouTube SEO tactics, and so many other things that will set you up as a successful YouTuber." />
