  <title>Death of a King - Seamus deFaoite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A gypsy king dies, and a group of villagers seek to save him from the dishonour of a pauper&#39;s grave. The dispute over the inheritance of a well-field becomes a struggle between the &#39;old stock&#39; and the &#39;new people&#39; for the very ownership of their town. A terrier pup reveals the truth of the relationship between a poacher and gamekeeper. A seasoned drinker subverts the &#39;dry&#39; policy of a train chartered by a Pioneer pilgrimage. An old man puts on his best suit for this own wake, telling his family he will be dead by nightfall. And a blind woman only truly realizes her blindness when forced to abandon her home. Stories of enduring friendships and close family ties form the heart of Death of a King. Often hilarious, and as fresh as the day they were written, these stories delicately but potently reveal their characters&#39; lives in all their toughness and tenderness." />
