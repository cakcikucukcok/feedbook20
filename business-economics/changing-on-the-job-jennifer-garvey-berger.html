  <title>Changing on the Job - Jennifer Garvey Berger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Listen to people in every field and you&#39;ll hear a call for more sophisticated leadership—for leaders who can solve more complex problems than the human race has ever faced. But these leaders won&#39;t simply come to the fore; we have to &lt;I&gt;develop&lt;/I&gt; them, and we must cultivate them as quickly as is humanly possible. &lt;I&gt;Changing on the Job&lt;/I&gt; is a means to this end.
As opposed to showing readers how to play the role of a leader in a &quot;paint by numbers&quot; fashion, &lt;I&gt;Changing on the Job&lt;/I&gt; builds on theories of adult growth and development to help readers become more thoughtful individuals, capable of leading in any scenario. Moving from the theoretical to the practical, and employing real-world examples, author Jennifer Garvey Berger offers a set of building blocks to help cultivate an agile workforce while improving performance.
Coaches, HR professionals, thoughtful leaders, and anyone who wants to flourish on the job will find this book a vital resource for developing their own capacities and those of the talent that they support." />
