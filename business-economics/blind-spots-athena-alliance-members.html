      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for Blind Spots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blind Spots&lt;/i&gt; is a great and valuable read. The story line makes it fun and interesting, and the learning makes it applicable. In each chapter, you will gain insights as to what you need to do as a leader, a team, and an organization to achieve high performance. Success does not just happen by luck; it is a very deliberate process, and Blind Spots will help guide you to your summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Kress, author of &lt;i&gt;Learning in Thin Air&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some leaders achieve great success, while others struggle? In this guide in narrative form, Russell Baxter, a fictional character and outgoing CEO, shares his secrets of success with incoming CEO Amir Ahmed. Baxter demonstrates that great leaders need to be aware of their vulnerabilities or blind spots and take action to make necessary changes.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter identifies twelve common blind spots that occur in business - things that companies cant see but that often drain productivity. He then shares with Ahmed a connection to an organization that will support him through the challenges that many companies and leaders miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through stories and examples, you will learn how to address weaknesses in customer service, communication, networking, listening, personal branding, and more. Filled with practical advice, &lt;i&gt;Blind Spots&lt;/i&gt; shows the value of drawing on experts to develop valuable skills that can take your business to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
