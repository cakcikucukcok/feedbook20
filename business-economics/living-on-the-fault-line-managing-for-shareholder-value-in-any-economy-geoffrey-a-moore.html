  <title>Living on the Fault Line: Managing for Shareholder Value in Any Economy - Geoffrey A. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The fault line -- that dangerous, unstable seam in the economy where powerful innovations and savage competition meet and create market-shattering tremors. Every company lives on it; no manager can control it. &lt;p&gt;In the original edition of &lt;em&gt;Living on the Fault Line,&lt;/em&gt; Geoffrey Moore presented a compelling argument for using shareholder value (or share price) as the key driver in management decisions. Moore now revisits his argument in the post-Internet bubble world, proving that the methods he espouses are more germane than ever and showing companies how to use them to survive and thrive in today&#39;s demanding economy. &lt;p&gt;Extending the themes of &lt;em&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inside the Tornado,&lt;/em&gt; his first two books on the dynamics of the high-tech markets, Moore shows why sensitivity to stock price is the single most important lever for managing in the future, both as a leading indicator of shifts in competitive advantage and as an employee motivator for making necessary changes in organizations heretofore impervious to change. &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This revised and updated edition includes:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A deeper emphasis on &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;context,&lt;/em&gt; which has emerged as the key distinction in allocating resources to improve shareholder value &lt;li&gt;A new Competitive Advantage Grid that will aid managers in achieving and sustaining competitive advantage, the most important component in managing for shareholder value &lt;li&gt;An expanded Value Discipline Model as it relates to the Competitive Advantage Grid &lt;li&gt;Analysis of the powerful new trend toward core/context analysis and outsourcing production duties &lt;li&gt;Updated models of organizational change for each stage of market development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As disruptive forces continue to buffet the marketplace and rattle the staid practices of the past, Moore offers a brilliant set of navigational tools to help meet today&#39;s most compelling management challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
