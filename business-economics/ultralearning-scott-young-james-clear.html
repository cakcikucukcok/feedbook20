      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education&amp;#8212;a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself&amp;#8212;among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polg&amp;#225;r, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship&amp;#8212;without knowing French. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; will guide you to success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
