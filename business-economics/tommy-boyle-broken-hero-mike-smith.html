  <title>Tommy Boyle - Broken Hero - Mike Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most gifted centre-halves of his day, Burnley captain Tommy Boyle won all of English footballs major honours; the FA Cup, League Championship and he represented England at international level. But once his playing days were over and after run-ins with the police and local authorities, the former international footballer was sent to Whittingham Mental Hospital, a former lunatic asylum.Broken Hero traces Boyle&#39;s career from his early days working as a miner in the militant South Yorkshire coalfield, to the proud day he became the first captain to be presented with the FA Cup by His Majesty, King George V. The story covers Boyle&#39;s experiences during the First World War where he served in the Royal Field Artillery and was badly wounded. The doctors gave him little chance of ever playing again, but he proved them all wrong and made a remarkable comeback to crown his career by leading Burnley to the Football League title in 1921. Tommy Boyle - Broken Hero tells the story of a great character and explores the circumstances that led to one of footballs first celebrity players being locked away in a mental hospital for the rest of his life unable to tell his story. Until now." />
