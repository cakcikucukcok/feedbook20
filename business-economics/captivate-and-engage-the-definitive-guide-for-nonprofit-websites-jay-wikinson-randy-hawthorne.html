THAT would not be possible without the online tools we&lt;br /&gt; offer for people to get involved. Firespring has been instrumental in helping us to&lt;br /&gt; realize our vision with respect to our website, our online event-in-a-box offerings,&lt;br /&gt; and our associated digital marketing capabilities. What has helped us to succeed is&lt;br /&gt; now available to you in this must-read for any nonprofit competing in today&amp;rsquo;s market-&lt;br /&gt; driven environments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;mdash;Kathleen Ruddy, CEO, St. Baldrick&amp;rsquo;s Foundation&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t miss this! It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderfully readable guide for nonprofits about how to create&lt;br /&gt; an online presence that is focused on donors and optimized for results. Every single&lt;br /&gt; organization these days needs to be having honest and fluid conversations with their&lt;br /&gt; constituents. Jay and Randy do a remarkable job of showing how an engaging website&lt;br /&gt; can facilitate those conversations and foster donor loyalty for the long haul.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;mdash;Beth Kanter, Trainer, Speaker and Author, Beth&amp;rsquo;s Blog, Co-Author, The&lt;br /&gt; Networked Nonprofit&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cool book. Easy to read. Practical. Accessible. Confirmed that Facebook isn&amp;rsquo;t the&lt;br /&gt; answer to everything. Reaffirmed my commitment to blogging. And I learned&lt;br /&gt; bunches of new stuff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;mdash;Simone P. Joyaux, ACFRE, Adv Dip, Owner, Joyaux Associates, Co-Author&lt;br /&gt; of Keep Your Donors&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most donors, event attendees, volunteers and prospective donors will visit your website&lt;br /&gt; BEFORE they take action. Finally a resource that understands! A book filled with&lt;br /&gt; real-life, innovative ideas to help any nonprofit master their online presence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;mdash;Lori L. Jacobwith, Founder, Ignited Fundraising&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Captivate and Engage is a must-read for every nonprofit, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t have a&lt;br /&gt; website redesign project on the horizon.
