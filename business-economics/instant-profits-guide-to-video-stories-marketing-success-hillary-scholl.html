Image and video marketing has never been more important. Video marketing is known to increase revenue by 49%. Imagine if you started getting 50% more sales in your business. What would you do with that increase? Would you expand your business even more? &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
If you think about video marketing and instantly feel overwhelmed, it&amp;rsquo;s understandable. Videos can be a more complex form of advertising. But the good news is that videos can be created quickly and easily once you know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;
Developing Your Image and Video Marketing Strategy&lt;br /&gt;
Focusing on image and video marketing in your business shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be done lightly. Like all business endeavors, it helps to have a plan. &amp;nbsp;Follow&amp;nbsp; new online&amp;nbsp; trending application you&amp;rsquo;ll feel more confident and find it easier to create videos.&lt;br /&gt;

If you want to attract more business with social media stories, incorporate more visuals, interact with your target market, and meet your business goals you&amp;rsquo;re about to learn how.&lt;br /&gt;
However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;ll have to put in a lot of extra time and effort to achieve your goals. In fact, this is an opportune time to make the needed changes. I say this because now is your chance to implement a very beneficial marketing method, social media stories.&lt;br /&gt;
These highly visual content forms, appeal to wide range of target markets, from young adults to the over-30 crowd. But, the best part is that with a little planning, social media stories can help you meet goals in every area of your business from website traffic to repeat sales.&lt;br /&gt;
Social media stories are still new, in the big scheme of things. By adding these very visual stories now, you can still get early-adoption benefits, which include being one of the people in your niche, who is on the ball with the latest marketing methods.&lt;br /&gt;

I&amp;#39;ll show you how to quickly attract more business with social media stories, incorporate more visuals, interact with your target market, and meet your business goals. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier than you think and I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a little secret, I am not particularly creative when it comes to images and videos. I don&amp;rsquo;t have that natural &amp;ldquo;vision&amp;rdquo; that designers have. BUT&amp;hellip;I do know my audience and what they want, which is very important to attracting and motivating them.&lt;br /&gt;
Why audiences love social media stories:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whole stories can be consumed in seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stories with hashtags are easy to find and access.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relevant stories make audiences feel more involved and important.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Audiences like seeing the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; you in &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo; situations.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s more personal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stories address their impulse wants, as well as here-and-now needs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Visual stories excite, intrigue, and empower the viewer with choices.&lt;/li&gt;
