  <title>The Future of Clean Energy - Gary Schwendiman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most bookson clean energy are so data-driven and scientific that theyre all but impossible to understand. Fortunately, this isnt one of them. Visionary author Gary Schwendiman answers theenergy sectors biggest questions in a way that anyone can understand andappreciate. This is as much a book for investors and political leaders as it is for the casualreader with an interest in how were going to solve some of the worlds most difficult environmental and economic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we combat global warming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we grow the global economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we turn the lights on for the 1.5 billion people in the world who currently lack access to electricity? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we provide all the additional fuel well need when the number of vehicles worldwide doubles from 1 billion to 2 billion by 2030?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book answers all these questions in a fun, lighthearted, engaging way. It compares the future of clean energy to a football season that concludes with what Schwendiman calls The Clean Energy Bowl. Join him as he examines each energy source as if it were a football team, comparing and contrasting the strongest players until he arrives at the ultimate conclusion: the team best positioned to completely change the world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;During the next few decades, the game will be rough, but the rewards significant. When the dust settles, the environment will be cleaner, the economy stronger, and the world more peaceful. So pack up the tailgate party. Grab your tickets. Get ready for kickoff!&lt;/p&gt;" />
