  <title>The Close - Stefan Aarnio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is more powerful than to influence and persuade the mind of another? To influence and persuade is to sell and to sell is human. In business and in life, there is only one way to make money and that is to sell. You either sell your time or you sell something else. The art of selling has always been powerful and will always be the key to reaching an unlimited income in business and in life. Natural salespeople, all have two things in common: they 1) follow a natural framework for their sales presentation and 2) they all sound amazing. A great salesperson is a blend of mechanics and delivery which creates both a logical and emotional argument for the sale. The Close lays out the framework, mechanics and delivery for the human mind so that you can effectively influence and persuade anyone regardless of your experience level. The Close provides a fresh new perspective on how to open the sale, present the value and close the sale using proven methods that have worked in all industries. Some of the techniques in this book have never been seen before and are so powerful that they could be used for tremendous good or evil if used by the wrong hands. With great power comes great responsibility and those who learn the techniques found in The Close must make a conscious effort to use the power in this book for good and not for evil. The power that you will possess by learning the techniques in this book is significant and you must make the choice to use your power in a positive way. Some people have abused this power in the past and it has ruined careers and lives, others have used this power in a positive way to serve others and become multi-millionaires and billionaires in the process. The power in The Close is neutral, like a loaded gun, how you choose to use this power is up to you." />
