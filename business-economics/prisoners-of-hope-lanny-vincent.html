  <title>Prisoners of Hope - Lanny Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of Hope&lt;/em&gt; opens a unique window into the minds and hearts of engineers, revealing two characteristics that every successful innovator must havefaith and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steering clear of spiritual clichs, &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of Hope&lt;/em&gt; provides practical insights and fresh accounts of innovators doing what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanny Vincent writes his book from his thirty years experience as facilitator, coach, and midwife of corporate innovating. He draws useful parallels between two seemingly different worlds of science and faith. Prior to working with companies like Hewlett-Packard, Sony Electronics, British Telecom, Rockwell, Weyerhaeuser or Whirlpool, Lanny was an ordained Presbyterian minister. From his early experiences within the research and development department of the company, Kimberly-Clark, the author saw familiar patterns among innovating scientists and engineersfaith patterns studied in a completely different context years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of Hope&lt;/em&gt; is filled with firsthand accounts of what really happens in the messy, serendipitous process of innovation, and how engineers use faith as their silent partner. Richly woven with the threads of current experience and ancient wisdom, &lt;em&gt;Prisoners&lt;/em&gt; makes explicit what innovators do naturally to bring their vision to the marketplacedone largely on the wings of faith and hope. The authors reinterpretations of biblical stories such as David and Goliath, Moses burning bush, and Abrahams aborted sacrifice of Isaac, will help you see the mysteries of faith in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an inspiring description of how innovators use these patterns to get the lift they need for innovating, and a practical play on the power and potential of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out how innovators get lift. You will get it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cohesive laminate of logic on innovation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Doug Gilmour, artist, advertising veteran, Clif Bar &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It] reconnected me with the fundamental power of faith and belief.&lt;/p&gt;
