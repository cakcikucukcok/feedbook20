  <title>Cloud Accounting - From Spreadsheet Misery to Affordable Cloud ERP - William Ph.D Aiton, David Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;...The mounting number of angry calls signaled James and his employees were starting to lose control of the business. Their QuickBooks accounting software and practice of using spreadsheets to manage projects and costs was buckling under the strain of an increased client load. If the problems continued, they could destroy the company.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you like to leverage software to increase your profits? This modern-day business parable helps you understand the process of qualifying a solution to meet your needs, and whether you should subscribe to an ERP cloud product or purchase an on-premises solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This quick read is written in the style of The One Minute Manager. It tells a fictitious story based on facts of Esther, a driven software company founder, and James, an analytical owner of a government contracting firm, who have outgrown their accounting software as they search for a way out of their QuickBooks and spreadsheet hell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in simple layman&amp;#39;s language, this is not a story for a technical person. It is for the executive or manager who want to better understand the cloud computing vs. on-premises computing debate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is cloud computing secure? Is it reliable? How about performance &amp;ndash; how quickly can you access your data? Learn this and more by reading this enjoyable story." />
