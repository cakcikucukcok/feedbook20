  <title>Resurrecting America&#39;s Entrepreneurial Spirit - Joe Nicassio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where Do Entrepreneurs Come From?
Entrepreneurs are ordinary people, with a spirit of creativity.
These people create commerce. When they are successful, they create JOBS.
Every living person on this planet has the fibers of creativity, just like we all have muscle fibers. Every person on this planet has the capacity to be an entrepreneur.
When we exercise our muscles, we get stronger, and if we dont, our muscles get weak, and atrophy.  The same concept applies to our business creation muscles. 
When we train our minds to create value, for the benefit of mankind, we become stronger entrepreneurs. When we fail to train our business fibers, business stagnates,  fewer jobs are created, and eventually, companies fold, and unemployment soars.
At the time of this writing, most entrepreneurs emerge as a societal aberration, because their Spirit is so strong, they are driven by clear purpose, a willingness to learn whatever it takes, and overcome all environmental and psychological barriers.
The thesis of this book is: In order to have a thriving capitalism tomorrow, we, as a nation, have an on-going vested interest in nurturing entrepreneurs today.
The book is divided into 3 major sections.
Section 1) Moving Our Economic Mentality From Employer-Reliance To Self-Reliance
Section 2) Eliminating Spirit Killers &amp; Replace Them With Spirit Builders
Section 3) Prayerful Meditation To Build Your Personal Spirit, and Create The Conditions For Miracles To Manifest in Your Business
This book is a unique approach to job creation. It is NOT about tax codes, economic policy, or regulations. It is about nurturing entrepreneurs at the grass roots level.
This book will remind you that if you want a &quot;dream job,&quot; you will need to create it for yourself. No one else is going to do it for you.
If you own a business, if you want to start a business, or you are interested in education reform, you will find this book thought-provoking, insightful, and uniquely valuable." />
