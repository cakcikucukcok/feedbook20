  <title>Personal Crucibles - Joe Mutizwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Personal Crucibles provides a compelling narrative about how adversity enables people to develop and grow as leaders. 
Through seven unique defining experiences Joe shows how he endured severe challenges through which he was able to discover his inner strength by channeling pain and bitterness caused by adversity and reversal into positive energy and learning that fueled his passion for achievement. 
The narrative demonstrates how a leader can lead an organization through crisis and chaos by remaining focused on attaining a desirable future that lies beyond the immediate crisis. 
The narrative graphically illustrates how loss, despair and setbacks can be transformed into positive energy that propels a person forward. 
Finally, the book illustrates how one can transition from a career to a calling through being challenged and through reflection on the meaning of life." />
