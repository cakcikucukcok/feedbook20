  <title>Subtle POWER: A Guide to the Human Operating System for Intentional Leaders - Gabriel Sakakeeny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to work as a leader in today&amp;#39;s business environment? In &lt;em&gt;Subtle POWER&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Gabriel Sakakeeny offers &amp;quot;Your job as a leader is to create and deliver an inspiring future of increasing value by causing effective action in yourself and others.&amp;quot; At a time when many businesses, from multinational corporations to start-ups, are realizing that the prevailing paradigm of talent management must yield to something more productive and successful,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Subtle POWER&lt;/em&gt;, offers a fresh, reality-based collaboration framework founded on accountability, self-empowerment, and effective communication. With roots in the Human Potential Movement, Sakakeeny asks the reader to pause and reflect on the language of tone, intellect, and spirit; language which has lost its integrity from unconscious overuse. He sets out a course for persons in positions of trust and influence to become &amp;quot;unconsciously competent in the art of leadership.&amp;quot; How does a leader go about this transformation? Sakakeeny&amp;#39;s methodology is the result of a unique body of experience blending over thirty years in business as a C-level executive, entrepreneur, inventor, engineer, marketer, and consultant with over forty years of leading symphonic orchestras. &lt;em&gt;Subtle POWER&lt;/em&gt; contains a toolbox of logically organized foundational concepts. Building on these, he expertly layers ever more detailed ideas using familiar stories and helpful analogies to provide a succinct narrative. All the while, the chapters of &lt;em&gt;Subtle POWER&lt;/em&gt; are structured so that, as concepts are introduced and explored, previous points are integrated as a means to introduce subsequent ideas. Chapters conclude with a summary and exercise, &lt;em&gt;Think On This&lt;/em&gt;, wherein the reader can begin to practically apply the new conceptual information to improve leadership competency&amp;nbsp;and living skills. By exploring foundational frameworks such as &lt;em&gt;The Fields of Existence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Five Modes of Intention&lt;/em&gt;, along with several other key constructs, leaders and aspiring leaders receive guidance and wisdom on the way to becoming intentional, conscious, and ultimately happier and more successful leaders.&lt;/p&gt;" />
