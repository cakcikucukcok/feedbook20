  <title>The Financially Literate Teacher - Mark A. Peacock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you wonder how you could ever stand in front of a group of children or adults and teach them about financial literacy when you dont feel like a very financially literate person? Do you wonder how to teach others about entrepreneurship when you arent an entrepreneur? Do you wonder how to encourage more teachers to teach financial literacy to students? Do you wish you had a resource that could help you learn these topics faster, better, and in a way that reduces your emotional and personal exposure? This book will show you how to turn what you already know about the world of business and financial literacy into fantastic teachable moments for your students. You will also learn how to turn what you dont know about the world of entrepreneurship and personal finance into wonderful opportunities for learning and personal development for you and your students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to discuss key financial concepts in a relaxed and comfortable format; what we have attitudes about and why, how we see our finances and the finances of others, and where we all fit in the overall financial landscape. Learn how to bring out the best personal financial insights from students and to bring out the absolute truth of your own financial experiences. This book will help you overcome the common fears all teachers experience when teaching students of any age the ups and downs of personal finance and entrepreneurship. If you teach or want to learn more about money, finance, or business, this book should be in your personal and school libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Special Bonus Section&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
