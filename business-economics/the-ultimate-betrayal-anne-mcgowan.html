      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world are watching their parents and other loved ones grow olderand those elderly people are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its not only dying or getting sick they have to worry about: As people get older, they become easy prey for criminals who want to separate them and future generations from their hard-earned money and assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide to protecting yourself and recognizing when a loved one is at risk, youll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; take preventative steps to ensure elder abuse never starts;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; recognize when someone might be trying to take advantage of a loved one;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; navigate the complicated process of stepping in to take care of an elderly loved one; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; promote widespread respect and dignity for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGowan draws on real-life experiences to show the profound implications of letting yourself or a loved one be taken for a fool. &lt;/p&gt;
