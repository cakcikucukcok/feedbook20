  <title>Inbound PR - Iliyana Stareva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The digital era’s new consumer demands a new approach to PR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inbound PR&lt;/i&gt; is the handbook that can transform your agency’s business. Today’s customer is fundamentally different, and traditional PR strategies are falling by the wayside. Nobody wants to feel “marketed to;” we want to make our own choices based on our own research and experiences online. When problems arise, we demand answers on social media, directly engaging the company in front of a global audience. We are the most empowered, sophisticated customer base in the history of PR, and PR professionals must draw upon an enormous breadth of skills and techniques to serve their clients’ interests. Unfortunately, those efforts are becoming increasingly ephemeral and difficult to track using traditional metrics. This book merges content and measurement to give today’s PR agencies a new way to build brands, evaluate performance and track ROI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ability to reach the new consumer, build the relationship, and quantify the ROI of PR services allows you to develop an inbound business and the internal capabilities to meet and exceed the needs of the most demanding client. In this digital age of constant contact and worldwide platforms, it’s the only way to sustainably grow your business and expand your reach while bolstering your effectiveness on any platform. This book shows you what you need to know, and gives you a clear framework for putting numbers to reputation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build brand awareness without “marketing to” the audience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Generate more, higher-quality customer or media leads&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Close the deal and nurture the customer or media relationship&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Track the ROI of each stage in the process&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Content is the name of the game now, and PR agencies must be able to prove their worth or risk being swept under with obsolete methods. &lt;i&gt;Inbound PR&lt;/i&gt; provides critical guidance for PR growth in the digital era, complete with a practical framework for stimulating that growth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
