  <title>New Ideas from Dead CEOs - Todd G. Buchholz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Ideas from Dead CEOs&lt;/em&gt; uncovers the secrets of success of great CEOs by giving readers an intimate look at their professional and personal lives. Why did Ray Kroc&#39;s plan for McDonald&#39;s thrive when many burger joints failed? And how, decades later, did Krispy Kreme fail to heed Kroc&#39;s hard-won lessons? How did Walt Disney&#39;s most dismal day as a young cartoonist radically change his career? When Est&amp;#233;e Lauder was a child in Queens, New York, the average American spent $8 a year on toiletries. Why did she spot an opportunity in selling high-priced cosmetics, and why did she pound on Saks&#39;s doors? How did Thomas Watson Jr. decide to roll the dice and put all of IBM&#39;s chips on computing, when his father thought it could be a losing idea? We learn about these CEOs&#39; greatest challenges and failures, and how they successfully rode the waves of demographic and technological change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Ideas from Dead CEOs&lt;/em&gt; not only gives us fascinating insights into these CEOs&#39; lives, but also shows how we can apply their ideas to the present-day triumphs and struggles of Sony, Dell, Costco, Carnival Cruises, Time Warner, and numerous other companies trying to figure out how to stay on top or climb back up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The featured CEOs in this book were not candidates for sainthood. Many of them knew &quot;god&quot; only as a prefix to &quot;dammit.&quot; But they were devoted to their businesses, not just to their egos and their personal bank accounts and yachts. Extraordinarily fresh and deeply thoughtful, Todd G. Buchholz&#39;s &lt;em&gt;New Ideas from Dead CEOs&lt;/em&gt; is a truly enjoyable and fun&amp;#8212;yet serious and realistic&amp;#8212;look at what we still have to learn and absorb from these decomposing CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
