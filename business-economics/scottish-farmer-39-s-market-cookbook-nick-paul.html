  <title>Scottish Farmer&#39;s Market Cookbook - Nick Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scotland has an enviable reputation for producing some of the finest food in the world. Langoustines from the West Coast of Scotland are eaten at tables all over Europe; the Scottish Aberdeen Angus has long been the byword for quality meat; Scottish soft raspberries and tayberries are considered the finest available, and so the list goes on! Scottish kitchens are moving away from the global produce offered by supermarkets and are returning to locally-produced, seasonal food. Local growers and producers are supplying markets from the Borders up to Orkney and they are becoming increasingly popular. Farmers&#39; markets in Scotland are a mix of greengrocer, butcher, garden-centre, off-licence, game dealer, delicatessan and more. The buyer has the opportunity to meet and speak to each farmer about the produce, making the shopping experience enjoyable and personal. The Scottish Farners&#39; Market Cookbook is a collection of recipes from producers and stallholders and reflects the produce that can be found at these Markets. The recipes are simple and delicious and range from Beef sausages with Wild Mushrooms poached in Red Wine, to Pork and Apple with Ginger Jam; from Beetroot and Goat&#39;s Cheese Starter to Apple Water Ice. As well as delicious, easy-to-use recipes, the Scottish Farmers&#39; Market Cookbook includes sections on seasonal growth, an availability guide, a producers list, farmers&#39; market venues, and conversion chart for weights and measures. This cookbook demonstrates that fine cooking need not be difficult and shopping at the Farmers&#39; Market for all your ingredients will produce the best in taste and guarantee a fresh, quality meal. A handy, easy to use size that can be taken around on Farmers&#39; Market days, with sections for notes, this book will prove to be indispensable!Scotland has an enviable reputation for producing some of the finest food in the world.
