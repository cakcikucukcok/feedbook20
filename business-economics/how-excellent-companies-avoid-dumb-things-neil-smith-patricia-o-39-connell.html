During his experience transforming some of the top global businesses, Smith has identified 8 barriers that exist in every organization and prevent them from implementing literally thousands of ideas to improve the way they work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;voiding Controversy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;oor Use of Time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;eluctance to Change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rganizational Silos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;anagement Blockers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;ncorrect Information and Bad Assumptions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ize Matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;xisting Processes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich with anecdotes and case studies, Smith identifies the ways in each of these barriers interrupt your own business.
