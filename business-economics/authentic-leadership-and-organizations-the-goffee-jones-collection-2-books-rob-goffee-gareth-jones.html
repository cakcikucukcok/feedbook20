Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers&amp;#8217; hearts, minds, and souls. In &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Why Should Anyone Work Here?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, the authors argue that it used to be that businesses could ask individuals to conform to the organization&amp;#8217;s needs but that now today&amp;#8217;s leaders are charged with creating the best company on earth to work for: they must transform their organizations to attract the right people, keep them, and inspire them to do their best work.&lt;/div&gt;" />
