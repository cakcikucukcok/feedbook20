  <title>Forgotten Ellis Island: Fear and Fever on Ellis Island - Lorie Conway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A century ago, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, one of the world&#39;s greatest public hospitals was built. Massive and modern, the hospital&#39;s twenty-two state-of-the-art buildings were crammed onto two small islands, man-made from the rock and dirt excavated during the building of the New York subway. As America&#39;s first line of defense against immigrant-borne disease, the hospital was where the germs of the world converged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ellis Island hospital was at once welcoming and foreboding&amp;#8212;a fateful crossroad for hundreds of thousands of hopeful immigrants. Those nursed to health were allowed entry to America. Those deemed feeble of body or mind were deported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three short decades after it opened, the Ellis Island hospital was all but abandoned. As America after World War I began shutting its border to all but a favored few, the hospital fell into disuse and decay, its medical wards left open only to the salt air of the New York Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With many never-before-published photographs and compelling, sometimes heartbreaking stories of patients (a few of whom are still alive today) and medical staff, &lt;em&gt;Forgotten Ellis Island&lt;/em&gt; is the first book about this extraordinary institution. It is a powerful tribute to the best and worst of America&#39;s dealings with its new citizens-to-be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
