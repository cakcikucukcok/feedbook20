  <title>Ten Green Bottles - Vivian Jeanette Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To Nini Karpel, growing up in Vienna during the 1920s was a romantic confection.  Whether schussing down ski slopes or speaking of politics in coffee houses, she cherished the city of her birth.  But in the 1930s an undercurrent of conflict and hate began to seize the former imperial capital.  This struggle came to a head when Hitler took possession of neighboring Germany.  Anti-Semitism, which Nini and her idealistic friends believed was impossible in the socially advanced world of Vienna, became widespread and virulent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Karpel&#39;s Jewish identity suddenly made them foreigners in their own homeland.  Tormented, disenfranchised, and with a broken heart, Nini and her family sought refuge in a land seven thousand miles across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai, China, one of the few countries accepting Jewish immigrants, became their new home and refuge.  Stepping off the boat, the Karpel family found themselves in a land they could never have imagined.  Shanghai presented an incongruent world of immense wealth and privilege for some and poverty for the masses, with opium dens and decadent clubs as well as rampant disease and a raging war between nations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ten Green Bottles&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Nini Karpel&#39;s struggles as she told it to her daughter Vivian so many years ago.  This true story depicts the fierce perseverance of one family, victims of the forces of evil, who overcame suffering of biblical proportion to survive.  It was a time when ordinary people became heroes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
