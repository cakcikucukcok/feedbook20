  <title>The New Zealand Cross - Dr. Brian L Kieran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The New Zealand Cross 
There has been no comprehensive history of the award published in one place. Dr. Kieran explores the development of the creation and inauguration of the award, a listing of all the recipients and an outline of the New Zealand Wars from 1860 to 1872. The Victoria Cross and other decorations were being awarded to Imperial troops but the settlers in the Volunteers and Militia were not being recognised for carrying out similar acts of bravery. The recognition of acts worthy of the NZC were anticipated to become well known; however, the awards spand a period to 1910 and thus the impact of the bravery leading to an award of the NZC was not achieved. Personalities like King Tawhiao, Sir George Bowen, Sir George Grey, Lt. General Cameron, Te Kooti, Titokowaru, and Major General Whitmore were involved in the conflict. A major issue leading to battles arose due to land confiscation by the settlers. The battles were mainly restricted to the North Island; Taranaki and Wanganui on the West Coast, Waikato in the Central area and on the East Coast at, Gisborne, Napier, Tauranga, and the Urewera." />
