  <title>When They Go Low, We Go High - Philip Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;When First  Lady Michelle Obama approached the podium at the 2016 Democratic  National Convention, nobody could have predicted that her rousing and emotional  &quot;When they go low, we go high+? speech would go on to become the motto for the  political left and an anthem for opponents of oppression worldwide. It was a  speech with the kind of emotional pull rarely heard these days, joining a long  list of addresses that have made history. But what about Obama&#39;s speech made it  so great?When  They Go Low, We Go High explores the most notable speeches in history,  analyzing the rhetorical tricks to uncover how the right speech at the right  time can profoundly shape the world. Traveling across continents and centuries,  political speechwriter Philip Collins reveals what Thomas Jefferson owes to  Cicero and Pericles, who really gave the Gettysburg Address, and what Elizabeth  I shares with Winston Churchill.In  telling the story of great and sometimes infamous speeches--including those from  Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, JFK, Martin Luther King, Jr., Disraeli, Hitler, Elie  Wiesel, Margaret Thatcher, and Barack and  Michelle Obama--Collins breathes new life into words you thought you knew well,  telling the story of democracy. Whether it&#39;s the inaugural addresses of  presidents or the revolutionary writings of Castro, Pankhurst, and Mandela,  Collins illuminates and contextualizes these moments with sensitivity and  humor. When They Go Low, We Go High is a  strong defense of the power of public speaking to propagate and protect  democracy and an urgent reminder that when great men and women speak to us,  their words can change the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
