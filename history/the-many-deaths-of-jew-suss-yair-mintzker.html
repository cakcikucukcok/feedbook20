  <title>The Many Deaths of Jew Suss - Yair Mintzker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joseph S&amp;#252;ss Oppenheimer&amp;#8212;&quot;Jew S&amp;#252;ss&quot;&amp;#8212;is one of the most iconic figures in the history of anti-Semitism. In 1733, Oppenheimer became the &quot;court Jew&quot; of Carl Alexander, the duke of the small German state of W&amp;#252;rttemberg. When Carl Alexander died unexpectedly, the W&amp;#252;rttemberg authorities arrested Oppenheimer, put him on trial, and condemned him to death for unspecified &quot;misdeeds.&quot; On February 4, 1738, Oppenheimer was hanged in front of a large crowd just outside Stuttgart. He is most often remembered today through several works of fiction, chief among them a vicious Nazi propaganda movie made in 1940 at the behest of Joseph Goebbels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Many Deaths of Jew S&amp;#252;ss&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling new account of Oppenheimer&#39;s notorious trial. Drawing on a wealth of rare archival evidence, Yair Mintzker investigates conflicting versions of Oppenheimer&#39;s life and death as told by four contemporaries: the leading inquisitor in the criminal investigation, the most important eyewitness to Oppenheimer&#39;s final days, a fellow court Jew who was permitted to visit Oppenheimer on the eve of his execution, and one of Oppenheimer&#39;s earliest biographers. What emerges is a lurid tale of greed, sex, violence, and disgrace&amp;#8212;but are these narrators to be trusted? Meticulously reconstructing the social world in which they lived, and taking nothing they say at face value, Mintzker conjures an unforgettable picture of &quot;Jew S&amp;#252;ss&quot; in his final days that is at once moving, disturbing, and profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Many Deaths of Jew S&amp;#252;ss&lt;/i&gt; is a masterfully innovative work of history, and an illuminating parable about Jewish life in the fraught transition to modernity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
