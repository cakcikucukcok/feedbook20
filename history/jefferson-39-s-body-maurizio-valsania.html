  <title>Jefferson&#39;s Body - Maurizio Valsania</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did Thomas Jefferson look like? How did he carry himself? Such
    questions, reasonable to ask as we look back on a person who lived in an era before photography,
    are the starting point for this boldly original new work. Maurizio Valsania considers all
    aspects of Jefferson’s complex conception of &quot;the body,&quot; from eighteenth-century
    clothing and fashion to manners, adornment, posture, gesture, and visual and material culture.
    Drawing also from the fields of medical science, psychology, and cultural anthropology, the
    author conjures a vivid and detailed re-creation of the third president as a living,
    breathing—and pondering—human being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having situated Jefferson in his own
    body, Valsania looks at the embodied Jefferson in the world of his fellow humans. Any one of the
    other people in Jefferson’s society—whether that other person was male or female, free or
    enslaved, African American or Native American—was a critical counterexample for the
    eighteenth-century Virginian to define himself against, and Valsania’s explorations here
    lead to numerous insightful discoveries about race, gender, and structures of power. The first
    comprehensive exploration of Jefferson’s corporeal world, &lt;i&gt;Jefferson’s
    Body&lt;/i&gt; brings the man vividly to life for the modern reader while deepening our
    understanding of what it meant to Jefferson to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
