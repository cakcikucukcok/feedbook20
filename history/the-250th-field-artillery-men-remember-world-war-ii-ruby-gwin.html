  <title>The 250Th Field Artillery Men Remember World War Ii - Ruby Gwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The war memories for each were not easy to tell or write, for some had repressed them long ago. We have been able to live the American Dream through dedicated soldiers as the 250th Field Artillerymen. They spent many nights together away from home with ties that would bind them together that has never loosened over the years. Their stories are inspiring ones of faith, courage, patriotism and some told with humor, which helped to put their experience into perspective - somewhat! During this time, our people here at home were doing their part in everyway they could. Everyone listened to the radio for further news. The good news finally came - from &quot;Day of Infamy&quot; to &quot;VE-VJ Day!&quot; As a light weight 105mm howitzer battalion they would become known for their firing power. They made history and are leaving a legacy to be most proud. They proved they still can answer to the call of duty. I am proud to say, never once did I not enjoy my work with each of these men. Let&#39;s just say - we have a deeper friendship than when we began this project together. I became their ears and wrote the word for many of them. I scribbled making notes as they talked and then, when hunched over my keyboard to translate from them working into the early morning hours. I pray I conveyed each story as each of them would have. As I wrote, I got the sense what the American flag meant to each - it symbolized a Tradition of Caring. I wrote with a lump in my throat and a tear in my eyes and, yes, a little snicker." />
