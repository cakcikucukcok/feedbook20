  <title>Hurricane Katrina and I - Antonio Q. Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I would like to share some of my experience while serving in New Orleans, Louisiana.  This deployment was my first major deployment in which just about every Army National Guard and Air Guard in the union was involved.  This joint task force also includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, and Reserve Forces.  The U.S. Coast Guard was deeply involved the relief efforts as well.  I was impressed to see the Army 82nd Airborne Division and the 1st Calvary Division playing a major role along with National Guard units.
This as if all America came to the aide of its own.   I even witness law enforcement from all over the country convoying to the Gulf State to lend a helping hand.  I would like to thank the church and the people of Mississippi for their warm and loving hospitality as we travel towards New Orleans.
This experience is an experience I will never forget.  I was told by Iraqi Freedom veterans that New Orleans look and smells like Baghdad Iraq.  I had never experience war upfront or combat but I was always in training for war and supported the war efforts.  
I see this relief effort as preparation for what is to come in my life.  I was told this is just the beginning.  The Guard, Reserve and Active components will play a more active role in our homeland relief efforts.
I am forever changed I thought Hurricane Frances and Ivan was something. Hurricane Katrina affected everyone nationwide.   I&#39;m glad to play major part in the relief effort and be a blessing not just to the people of New Orleans and Louisiana but also to the people of Alabama and Mississippi." />
