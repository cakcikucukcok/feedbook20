  <title>The Longest Fight - William Gildea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people came to Goldfield, Nevada, America&#39;s last gold-rush town, to seek their fortune. However, on a searing summer day in September 1906, they came not to strike it rich but to watch what would become the longest boxing match of the twentieth century--between Joe Gans, the first African American boxing champion, and &quot;Battling&quot; Nelson, a vicious and dirty brawler. It was a match billed as the battle of the races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            In &lt;i&gt;The Longest Fight&lt;/i&gt;, the longtime &lt;i&gt;Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;sports correspondent William Gildea tells the story of this epic match, which would stretch to forty-two rounds and last two hours and forty-eight minutes. A new rail line brought spectators from around the country, dozens of reporters came to file blow-by-blow accounts, and an entrepreneurial crew&#39;s film of the fight, shown in theaters shortly afterward, endures to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;            The Longest Fight &lt;/i&gt;also recounts something much greater--the longer battle that Gans fought against prejudice as the premier black athlete of his time. It is a portrait of life in black America at the turn of the twentieth century, of what it was like to be the first black athlete to successfully cross the nation&#39;s gaping racial divide. Gans was smart, witty, trim, and handsome--with one-punch knockout power and groundbreaking defensive skills--and his courage despite discrimination prefigured the strife faced by many of America&#39;s finest athletes, including Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, and Muhammad Ali.&lt;br&gt;            Inside the ring and out, Gans took the first steps for the African American athletes who would follow, and yet his role in history was largely forgotten until now. &lt;i&gt;The Longest Fight &lt;/i&gt;is a reminder of the damage caused by the bigotry that long outlived Gans, and the strength, courage, and will of those who fought to rise above.&lt;/p&gt;" />
