  <title>Franklin Delano Roosevelt - Roy Jenkins, Jr. Arthur M. Schlesinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A masterly work by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Churchill &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Gladstone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A protean figure and a man of massive achievement, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the only man to be elected to the presidency more than twice. In a ranking of chief executives, no more than three of his predecessors could truly be placed in contention with his standing, and of his successors, there are so far none. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In acute, stylish prose, Roy Jenkins tackles all of the nuances and intricacies of FDR&#39;s character. He was a skilled politician with astounding flexibility; he oversaw an incomparable mobilization of American industrial and military effort; and, all the while, he aroused great loyalty and dazzled those around him with his personal charm. Despite several setbacks and one apparent catastrophe, his life was buoyed by the influence of Eleanor, who was not only a wife but an adviser and one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest political reformers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly complete before Jenkins&#39;s death in January 2003, this volume was finished by historian Richard Neustadt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
