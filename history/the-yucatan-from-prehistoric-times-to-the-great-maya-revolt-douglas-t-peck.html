  <title>The Yucatan-From Prehistoric Times to the Great Maya Revolt - Douglas T. Peck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book introduces an innovative and verified pattern of Maya history that follows the origin of the Olmec culture in Tabasco through its melding into and becoming the Chontal Maya/Itza of the Yucatan.  The Yucatan has been the focal point and geographical crossroad of profound cultural, ethnological, and sociological change and development in Mesoamerica from ancient times to the present.  This far-reaching and historically significant acculturation was brought about by two widely separated epic migrations and military conquests by foreign peoples bringing radically new, innovative, and advanced culture to the area.  The first of these was the migration and military conquest by the Olmec/Chontal Maya/Itza from Tabasco bringing their written language, mathematics, architectural expertise, and religion into northern and central Yucatan.  This golden age of Maya civilization, centered in the Yucatan, lasted for a millennium during which the advanced Maya culture flowered and spread south into Honduras and Guatemala and west into the highlands of Mexico.  In like manner, the second migration and military conquest of the Yucatan by Spanish conquistadors also brought new and advanced cultural norms to the area.  The history of the origin, development, and impact of these two momentous events constitutes the thrust of this book and is contrary to and challenges much of the currently accepted historiography related to the subject.
Contrary to current consensus the book shows that the seafaring and mercantile oriented Chontal Maya/Itza from Yucatan were a populous worldly element of the Maya civilization who traveled and spread their cultural influence not only throughout continental Mesoamerica, but ventured across the seas to the islands of the Caribbean and to the shores of Southwest Florida in the territory of the Calusa Indians.  Consistent with this accomplishment, they had developed naval engineering, Metallurgy, tool design, woodworking, and ship building capabilities that enabled them to construct the large composite seaworthy vessels (not just log canoes) required.  And from their expertise in mathematics and astronomy they developed a sophisticated method of celestial navigation for their overseas voyages a millennium before celestial navigation was developed in Europe." />
