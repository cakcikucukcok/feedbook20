The illustrated sections which follow focus on notable themes and topics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The hundreds of unique images in &lt;I&gt;China Illustrated&lt;/I&gt;, including early engravings and maps, hand&amp;#150;colored prints, studio portraits and amateur photographs, postcards, drawings and cartons come from the private collection of Arthur Hacker.  Collected with the eye of an artist and the knowledge of a historian they eloquently bring China&#39;s social history to life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
