  <title>The Life of the Skies - Jonathan Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aerial delights: A history of America as seen through the eyes of a bird-watcher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John James Audubon arrived in America in 1803, when Thomas Jefferson was president, and lived long enough to see his friend Samuel Morse send a telegraphic message from his house in New York City in the 1840s. As a boy, Teddy Roosevelt learned taxidermy from a man who had sailed up the Missouri River with Audubon, and yet as president presided over America&#39;s entry into the twentieth century, in which our ability to destroy ourselves and the natural world was no longer metaphorical. Roosevelt, an avid birder, was born a hunter and died a conservationist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, forty-six million Americans are bird-watchers. &lt;i&gt;The Life of the Skies &lt;/i&gt;is a genre-bending journey into the meaning of a pursuit born out of the tangled history of industrialization and nature longing. Jonathan Rosen set out on a quest not merely to see birds but to fathom their centrality--historical and literary, spiritual and scientific--to a culture torn between the desire both to conquer and to conserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosen argues that bird-watching is nothing less than the real national pastime--indeed it is more than that, because the field of play is the earth itself. We are the players and the spectators, and the outcome--since bird and watcher are intimately connected--is literally a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
