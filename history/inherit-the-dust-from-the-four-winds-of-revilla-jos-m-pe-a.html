  <title>Inherit the Dust from the Four Winds of Revilla - José M. Peña</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rich in period analysis, here is fascinating historical perspective covering 250 years of existence primarily of a 1750 Spanish settlement originally called Villa del Seor San Ignacio de Loyola de Revilla and now known as &quot;Guerrero Viejo.&quot; Although many books cover the genealogical aspects of families that originated in this city, the historical contributions of the early pioneers, their descendents, and the controversy related to land grants, called Porciones -- awarded by the King of Spain -- have, for the most part, remained in the background.  This, then, is the principal objective of this book.  The book provides summaries on the evolution, history, wars, and problems of Mexico.  Using some of his ancestors as a sample, the author shows the hardships they endured and discusses their contribution in the formation of the two great nations that the United States and Mexico have become.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At the same time, the book shows that the land grants (and heirs) took one of two alternate roads -- depending on their location -- when Texas and other territories were ceded to the United States.  People and land grants located on the Mexican side were victims of the violent and blood soaked history that Mexico has had.  On the other hand, those located on the U.S. side, were subjected to mischief and flagrant violations of the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  Sadly, in 1953, the Falcon Dam inundated Guerrero Viejo and many of the land grants.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thus, for all intents and purposes, the heirs of most land grants met the same end and a financial obligation (of $193.0 Million plus interest) exchanged between the U.S. and Mexico has remained unpaid for over 80 years.  The reader will long-remember the amazing facts developed in this book." />
