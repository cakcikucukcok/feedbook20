  <title>A History of Brewers in Portsmouth, Ohio - William Cullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A History of Brewers in Portsmouth, Ohio, with an Emphasis on the Portsmouth Brewing Company: Part IIthe 20th &amp; 21st Centuries is a continuation of A History of Brewers in Portsmouth, Ohio, with an Emphasis on the Portsmouth Brewing Company: Part One: The 19th Century, also available through Xlibris Publishing. The second book picks up where part one left off, moving on from the demise of brewery patriarch Julius Esselborn to his sonsPaul Esselbornturbulent tenure as general manager of the Portsmouth Brewery, as well as his contributions to Portsmouth as a community leader. From there, the book recounts the many uses of the brewerybottler to car dealership to arcadebrought on by the Prohibition and post-Prohibition era before returning back to its original roots as a craft brewery by two local brothers, Steven and Ira Mault.
These two books are a look back into the history of Portsmouth, Ohio, my hometown, from the viewpoint of beer brewing, a major part of this community from its very early days to its present and, hopefully, well into its future.
Cheers." />
