  <title>Legend of D. B. Cooper: Death By Natural Causes - Pat Forman, Ron Forman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He has been called A Northwest Folk Hero, Jesse James, and Billy the Kid. But until now, he hasn&#39;t been called a she. Contrary to popular belief, D. B. Cooper not only survived the infamous hijacking on November 24, 1971. He also committed the high-flying caper as a woman. Cooper&#39;s real name was first Bobby then Barb Dayton. Cooper had gender reassignment surgery in December 1969. In 1971, he pulled his buccaneering swipe dressed as a man and walked away as a woman. Bobby/Barb lived to the age of seventy-six and died of natural causes on February 20, 2002.  In 1979, Barb described to the authors in great detail how she jumped from the famed 727. After Barb&#39;s death, the Formans began the fascinating journey of piecing together their dear friend&#39;s story and verifying her larger-than-life yarns. This book takes you, the reader, on that rollicking journey and allows you to decide-do you think Barb Dayton was D. B. Cooper?" />
