  <title>The Making of Medieval History - Graham A. Loud, Martial Staub</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A hugely interesting set of essays, reflecting on a variety of ways in which medieval history has developed to the present time. Scholarship of the highest standard, deeply thought-provoking and deeply engaged with the inheritances and future tasks of medieval academic history. The collection will be essential reading for all medievalists. John Arnold, Professor of Medieval History, University of Cambridge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Medieval history is present in many forms in our world. Monuments from the Middle Ages or inspired by them are a familiar feature of landscapes across Europe and beyond; the period between the end of the Roman Empire in Western Europe and the Reformation and European expansion is an essential part of our imagination, be it conveyed through literature, the arts, science fiction or even video games; it is also commonly invoked in political debates. Specialists in the field have played a major role in shaping modern perceptions of the era. But little is known about the factors that have influenced them and their work.&lt;BR&gt; The essays in this volume provide original insights into the fabric and dissemination of medieval history as a scholarly discipline from the late eighteenth century onwards. The case-studies range from the creation of specific images of the Middle Ages to the ways in which medievalists have dealt with European identity, contributed to making anddeconstructing myths and, more specifically, addressed questions relating to land and frontiers as well as to religion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Graham A. Loud is Professor of Medieval History at the University ofLeeds; Martial Staub is Professor of Medieval History at the University of Sheffield.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Contributors: Christine Caldwell Ames, Peter Biller, Michael Borgolte, Patrick Geary, Richard Hitchcock, Bernhard Jussen, Joep Leerssen, G.A. Loud, Christian L端bke, Jinty Nelson, Bastian Schl端ter, Martial Staub, Ian Wood." />
