      <meta name="description" content="Alas that I ever did sin!  It is so merry in Heaven!The Book of Margery Kempe (c. 1436-8) is the extraordinary account of a medieval wife, mother, and mystic.  Known as the earliest autobiography written in the English language, Kempes Book describes the dramatic transformation of its heroine from failed businesswoman and lustful young wife to devout and chaste pilgrim. She vividly describes her prayers and visions, as well as the temptations in daily life to which she succumbed before dedicating herself to her spiritualcalling. She travelled to the most holy sites of the medieval world, including Rome and Jerusalem.In her life and her boisterous devotion, Kempe antagonized many of those around her; yet she also garnered friends and supporters who helped to record her experiences. Her Book opens a window on to the medieval world, and provides a fascinating portrait of one womans life, aspirations, and prayers.  This new translation preserves the forceful narrative voice of Kempes Book and includes a wide-ranging introduction and useful notes.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxfords commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />
