  <title>Night - Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel, Barack Obama, Samantha Power...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A memorial edition of Elie Wiesel&#39;s seminal memoir of surviving the Nazi death camps, with tributes by President Obama and Samantha Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Elie Wiesel died in July 2016, the White House issued a memorial statement in which President Barack Obama called him &quot;the conscience of the world.&quot; The whole of the president&#39;s eloquent tribute serves as a foreword to this memorial edition of &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;Like millions of admirers, I first came to know Elie through his account of the horror he endured during the Holocaust simply because he was Jewish,&quot; wrote the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, when Wiesel received the Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wrote, &quot;Elie Wiesel was rescued from the ashes of Auschwitz after storm and fire had ravaged his life. In time he realized that his life could have purpose: that he was to be a witness, the one who would pass on the account of what had happened so that the dead would not have died in vain and so the living could learn.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt;, which has sold millions of copies around the world&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;is the very embodiment of that conviction. It is written in simple, understated language, yet it is emotionally devastating, never to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were deported to Auschwitz and then Buchenwald. &lt;i&gt;Night &lt;/i&gt;is the shattering record of his memories of the death of his mother, father, and little sister, Tsipora; the death of his own innocence; and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night,&quot; writes Wiesel. &quot;Never shall I forget . . . even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.&quot; These words are etched into the wall of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Far more than a chronicle of the sadistic realm of the camps, &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; also addresses many of the philosophical and personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to tributes from President Obama and Samantha Powers, this memorial edition of&lt;i&gt; Night &lt;/i&gt;includes the unpublished text of a speech that Wiesel delivered before the United Nations General Assembly on the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, entitled &quot;Will the World Ever Know.&quot; These remarks powerfully resonate with &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; and with subsequent acts of genocide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
