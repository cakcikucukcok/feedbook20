  <title>Gleanings in Buddha-Fields: Studies of Hand and Soul in the Far East - Lafcadio Hearn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This classic text about Buddhism in Japan by Lafcadio Hearn&amp;#8212;on of the first Westerns to write about Japan&amp;#8212;will be of great interests to scholars and Japanophiles alike.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s books continue to charm and captivate readers, as the exotic subjects about which he wrote charmed and captivated him. Gleanings In Buddha-Fields presents more Hearn magic as he enters into the spirit of Buddhism as though he were born into it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hearn says that if he were a god, dwelling in some old Izumo shrine on the summit of a hill, then &quot;as air to the bird, as water to the fish, so would all substance be permeable to the essence of me. I should pass at will into the walls of my dwelling to swim in the long gold bath of a sunbeam, to thrill in the heart of a flower, to ride on the neck of a dragonfly.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He writes of a trip to Kyoto, telling of hazy autumn rice fields, with dragonflies darting over the drooping grain; maples crimsoning above a tremendous gorge; ranges of peaks steeped in morning mist; and a peasant&#39;s cottage perched on the verge of some dizzy mountain road.&lt;/div&gt;" />
