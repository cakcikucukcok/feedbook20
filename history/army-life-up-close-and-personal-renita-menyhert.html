  <title>Army Life: up Close and Personal - Renita Menyhert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Army Life: Up Close and Personal
As an active duty and reserve Soldier, as well as Army wife and mother, there were times when I felt like I was cramming six lifetimes into one. These commentaries are about those occasions that produced laughter, adventure, even heartbreak. Some helped me to understand the importance of successfully completing missions while others afforded me opportunities to grow as a person, family member, and friend. Some even led me to spectacular events in life I might never have known. For those that read this book and recognize themselves, it is my prayer they will enjoy reliving all the great times with me. As for the rest of you, whether or not associated with military life, I trust you can relate in some way to these unique Army moments. After all, it could have been you!" />
