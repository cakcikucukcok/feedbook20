  <title>The Greatest Farce of History - Gopal Chowdhary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book seeks to analyse the faultlines and subversion in the ancient history of India in  the praxis of social domination and systematic marginalization and obliteration of traditional political elites or traditional Kshatriya that social elites (Priestly class or caste) of ancient India achieved, just to maintain their socio-political domination and hegemony. This rather myopic act led to the balkanization of socio-political scape of mediaeval Indiaresulting into subjugation, plunder and foreign invasions and rule for one thousand years.
Through the case study of Krishna and Mahabharata period, the book tries to illuminate the so called Dark Age of the Indian history. Despite the numerous archaeological proves found in the form of Painted Grey Ware (PGW) associated with Mahabharata period and Black Red Ware (BRW) with different shades, associated with Krishna and Yadavas which tally with details of different scriptures and epic, nothing seems to be happening in this regard. This very fact seems to underline the continued saga of subversion and domination that seemed to have been ingrained in the post-Krishna-and-Mahabharata period. Once the deification and mystification of great historical personality and period such as Krishna and Mahabharata was started just to negate the socio-political revolutions ushered into, it seems to have continued and institutionalized." />
