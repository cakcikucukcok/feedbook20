  <title>Up Above My Head - Carol Seay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These young colored girls suffered enormously in an abandoned ninety-eight-year-old civil war era stockade in 1963, and most Americans dont even know it happened.
Indeed, this too-little-known incident of the civil rights era haunts all who learn of it.
Many of the authorities involved, including Sheriff Fred Chappell and Police Chief Ross Chambliss, have died, and court records that might document the girls imprisonment have proven impossible to locate.
The year 1963 also had its triumphs. On August 28 of that year, while the girls shored up their courage by singing civil rights anthems inside the stockade, Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his indelible I Have a Dream speech in Washington, D.C.
This book is written to raise awareness. Its a very gripping story, one that needs to be preserved. These girls took a stand for justice and dignity at a very young age, and those who remain refuse to be silent after fifty-two years." />
