  <title>Scribal Repertoires in Egypt from the New Kingdom to the Early Islamic Period - Jennifer Cromwell, Eitan Grossman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scribal Repertoires in Egypt from the New Kingdom to the Early Islamic Period deals with the possibility of glimpsing pre-modern and early modern Egyptian scribes, the actual people who produced ancient documents, through the ways in which they organized and wrote those documents. While traditional research has focused on identifying a &#39;pure&#39; or &#39;original&#39; text behind the actual manuscripts that have come down to us from pre-modern Egypt, the volume looks
instead at variation - different ways of saying the same thing - as a rich source for understanding the complex social and cultural environments in which scribes lived and worked, breaking with the traditional conception of variation in scribal texts as &#39;free&#39; or indicative of &#39;corruption&#39;. As such, it presents
a novel reconceptualization of scribal variation in pre-modern Egypt from the point of view of contemporary historical sociolinguistics, seeing scribes as agents embedded in particular geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural environments. Introducing to Egyptology concepts such as scribal communities, networks, and repertoires, among others, the authors then apply them to a variety of phenomena, including features of lexicon, grammar, orthography, palaeography, layout, and format. After
first presenting this conceptual framework, they demonstrate how it has been applied to better-studied pre-modern societies by drawing upon the well-established domain of scribal variation in pre-modern English, before proceeding to a series of case studies applying these concepts to scribal variation
spanning thousands of years, from the languages and writing systems of Pharaonic times, to those of Late Antique and Islamic Egypt." />
