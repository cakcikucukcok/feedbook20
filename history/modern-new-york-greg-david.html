  <title>Modern New York - Greg David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The economic history of New York is filled with high-stakes drama and big figures. In &lt;i&gt;Modern New York&lt;/i&gt;,  renowned economist and political commentator Greg David tells the story of the metropolis&#39;s financial highs and lows since the 1960s. He takes a hard look at how Wall Street came to dominate the economy in the years following the wrenching decade of the Fiscal Crisis and how New York&#39;s high finance roller coaster came to affect the entire city and the world. He tackles the major controversies over real estate development, the growth of inequality, the role of immigration and the prospects for diversification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition &lt;i&gt;Modern New York&lt;/i&gt; profiles the business and political leaders at the forefront of today&#39;s economic issues, as well as the average people who benefit from (and are the casualties of) the structure and cycles of this hub&#39;s capricious economy. From covert breakfasts with Wall Street heads to profiles of people like the brilliant but complex economic development artist Dan Doctoroff, &lt;i&gt;Modern New York&lt;/i&gt; features all sorts of characters with big personalities and big wallets, from Donald Trump to Michael Bloomberg.&lt;br&gt;This book takes readers on a journey to understanding the machinery and people as well as the spirit of New York. With its many great stories and applicability to other metropolises such as London, Singapore, Sydney, or Hong Kong, it will be relevant to readers around the world..&lt;/p&gt;" />
