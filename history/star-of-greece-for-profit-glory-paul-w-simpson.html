  <title>Star of Greece - For Profit &amp; Glory - Paul W Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Star of Greece was an iron clipper ship built by Harland &amp; Wolff of Ireland for JP Corry of Belfast. For more than 20 years she plied the waters between Britain, India and Australia before coming to grief in 1888 with the loss of 18 lives. Her loss left many unanswered questions, including just who was aboard the &#39;Star of Greece&#39; and what happened to the men and boys on that fateful night over one hundred years ago. This book then answers these questions and many more as it traces the story of the ship, her masters and the fates of the survivors. Her tale is the story of the Calcutta jute trade that Corry&#39;s dominated for the best part of two decades with their fleet of twelve jute clippers - The Twelve Stars of Ireland." />
