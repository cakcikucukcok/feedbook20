  <title>Mexico in the 1940s: Modernity, Politics, and Corruption - Stephen R. Niblo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Attention to Mexico&#39;s history after 1940 stands in the shadow of the country&#39;s epic revolution of 1910D1923, and historians and scholars tend to bring their focus on Mexican history to a close with the end of the L_zaro C_rdenas presidency in 1940. Mexico in the 1940s: Modernity, Politics, and Corruption examines Mexican politics in the wake of Cardenismo, and the dawn of Miguel Alem_n&#39;s presidency. This new book focuses on the decade of the 1940s, and analyzes Alemanismo into the early years of the 1950s. Based upon a decade of intensive investigation, Mexico in the 1940s is the first broad and substantial study of the political life of the Mexican nation during this period, thus opening a new era to historical investigation.&lt;p&gt; Mexico in the 1940s offers a unique interpretation of the country&#39;s domestic politics during this period, including an explanation of how political leaders were able to reverse the course of the Mexican Revolution; an original interpretation of corruption in Mexican political life, a phenomenon that did not end in the 1940s; and an analysis of the relationship between the U.S. media interests, the Mexican state, and the Mexican media companies that still dominates mass communication today.&lt;p&gt; Mexico in the 1940s is an excellent volume for courses in Mexican history." />
