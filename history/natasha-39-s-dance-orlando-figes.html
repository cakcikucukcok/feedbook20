  <title>Natasha&#39;s Dance - Orlando Figes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History on a grand scale--an enchanting masterpiece that explores the making of one of the world&#39;s most vibrant civilizations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A People&#39;s Tragedy&lt;/i&gt;, wrote Eric Hobsbawm, did &quot;more to help us understand the Russian Revolution than any other book I know.&quot; Now, in &lt;i&gt;Natasha&#39;s Dance&lt;/i&gt;, internationally renowned historian Orlando Figes does the same for Russian culture, summoning the myriad elements that formed a nation and held it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the eighteenth century with the building of St. Petersburg--a &quot;window on the West&quot;--and culminating with the challenges posed to Russian identity by the Soviet regime, Figes examines how writers, artists, and musicians grappled with the idea of Russia itself--its character, spiritual essence, and destiny. He skillfully interweaves the great works--by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall--with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, from food and drink to bathing habits to beliefs about the spirit world. Figes&#39;s characters range high and low: the revered Tolstoy, who left his deathbed to search for the Kingdom of God, as well as the serf girl Praskovya, who became Russian opera&#39;s first superstar and shocked society by becoming her owner&#39;s wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the European-schooled countess Natasha performing an impromptu folk dance in Tolstoy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;War and Peace&lt;/i&gt;, the spirit of &quot;Russianness&quot; is revealed by Figes as rich and uplifting, complex and contradictory--a powerful force that unified a vast country and proved more lasting than any Russian ruler or state.&lt;/p&gt;" />
