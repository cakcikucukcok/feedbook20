  <title>Armistead and Garnett - Robert K. Krick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Virginians Lewis A. Armistead and Richard B. Garnett, two Confederate officers killed during Pickett&#39;s Charge at Gettysburg, lived remarkably parallel lives. In this Civil War Short, Robert K. Krick follows the two men from their early military careers fighting against American Indians and Mormons through two decades of military service and onto the field at Gettysburg, where both were mortally wounded. The work was originally published in &lt;i&gt;The Third Day at Gettysburg and Beyond&lt;/i&gt;, edited by Gary W. Gallagher, which combines fresh evidence with the reinterpretation of standard sources to testify to the enduring impact of the Civil War on our national consciousness and refocus our view of the third day at Gettysburg. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNC Press Civil War Shorts excerpt rousing narratives from distinguished books published by the University of North Carolina Press on the military, political, social, and cultural history of the Civil War era. Produced exclusively in ebook format, they focus on pivotal moments and figures and are intended to provide a concise introduction, stir the imagination, and encourage further exploration of the topic. For in-depth analysis, contextualization, and perspective, we invite readers to consider the original publications from which these works are drawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
