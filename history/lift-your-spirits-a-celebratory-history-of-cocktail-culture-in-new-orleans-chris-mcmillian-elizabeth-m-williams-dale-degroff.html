  <title>Lift Your Spirits: A Celebratory History of Cocktail Culture in New Orleans - Chris McMillian, Elizabeth M. Williams, Dale DeGroff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Sazerac, the Hurricane, and the absinthe glass of Herbsaint are among the many well-known creations native to New Orleans&#39;s longstanding drinking culture. But more than vehicles for alcohol, the cocktails and spirits that complement the city&#39;s culinary prowess are each a token of its history. In every bar-side toast or street-corner daiquiri you can find evidence of the people, politics, and convergence of ethnicities that drive the story of the Crescent City.&lt;br&gt;In Lift Your Spirits: A Celebratory History of Cocktail Culture in New Orleans, Elizabeth M. Williams, founder and director of the Southern Food and Beverage Institute, and world-renowned bartender Chris McMillian illuminate the city&#39;s open embrace of alcohol, both in religious and secular life, while delving into the myths, traditions, and personalities that have made New Orleans a destination for imbibing tourists and a mecca for mixologists.&lt;br&gt;With over 40 cocktail recipes interspersed among nearly three hundred years of history, a sampling of premier cocktail bars in New Orleans, and a glossary of terms to aid drink making and mixing, Lift Your Spirits honors the art of a good drink in the city of good times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
