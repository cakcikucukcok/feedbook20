  <title>Dunmore&#39;s New World: The Extraordinary Life of a Royal Governor in Revolutionary America--with Jacobites,     Counterfeiters, Land Schemes, Shipwrecks - James Corbett David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dunmore&#39;s New World&lt;/i&gt; tells the stranger-than-fiction     story of Lord Dunmore, the last royal governor of Virginia, whose long-neglected life boasts a     measure of scandal and intrigue rare in the annals of the colonial world. Dunmore not only     issued the first formal proclamation of emancipation in American history; he also undertook an     unauthorized Indian war in the Ohio Valley, now known as Dunmore&#39;s War, that was     instrumental in opening the Kentucky country to white settlement. In this entertaining     biography, James Corbett David brings together a rich cast of characters as he follows Dunmore     on his perilous path through the Atlantic world from 1745 to 1809.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunmore was     a Scots aristocrat who, even with a family history of treason, managed to obtain a commission in     the British army, a seat in the House of Lords, and three executive appointments in the American     colonies. He was an unusual figure, deeply invested in the imperial system but quick to break     with convention. Despite his 1775 proclamation promising freedom to slaves of Virginia rebels,     Dunmore was himself a slaveholder at a time when the African slave trade was facing tremendous     popular opposition in Great Britain. He also supported his daughter throughout the scandal that     followed her secret, illegal marriage to the youngest son of George III-a relationship that     produced two illegitimate children, both first cousins of Queen Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Within this single narrative, Dunmore interacts with Jacobites, slaves, land     speculators, frontiersmen, Scots merchants, poor white fishermen, the French, the Spanish,     Shawnees, Creeks, patriots, loyalists, princes, kings, and a host of others. This history     captures the vibrant diversity of the political universe that Dunmore inhabited alongside the     likes of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. A transgressive imperialist, Dunmore had an     astounding career that charts the boundaries of what was possible in the Atlantic world in the     Age of Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
