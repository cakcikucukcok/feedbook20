  <title>Stonewall&#39;s Prussian Mapmaker - Richard Brady Williams, Robert K. Krick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prussian-born cartographer Oscar Hinrichs was a key member of Stonewall Jackson&#39;s staff, collaborated on maps with Jedediah Hotchkiss, and worked alongside such prominent Confederate leaders as Joe Johnston, Richard H. Anderson, and Jubal Early. After being smuggled along the Rebel Secret Line in southern Maryland by John Surratt Sr., his wife Mary, and other Confederate sympathizers, Hinrichs saw action in key campaigns from the Shenandoah Valley and Antietam to Gettysburg, Petersburg, and Appomattox. After the Confederate surrender, Hinrichs was arrested alongside his friend Henry Kyd Douglas and imprisoned under suspicion of having played a role in the Booth conspiracy, though the charges were later dropped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hinrichs&#39;s detailed wartime journals, published here for the first time, shed new light on mapmaking as a tool of war, illuminate Stonewall Jackson&#39;s notoriously superior strategic and tactical use of terrain, and offer unique perspectives on the lives of common soldiers, staff officers, and commanders in Lee&#39;s army. Impressively comprehensive, Hinrichs&#39;s writings constitute  a valuable and revelatory primary source from the Civil War era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
