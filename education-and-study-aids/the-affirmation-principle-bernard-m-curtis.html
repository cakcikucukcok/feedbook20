  <title>The Affirmation Principle - Bernard M. Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take a look in any bookstore, whether on line or brick-and-mortar, and you will fi nd
dozens, even hundreds of books on leadership. But the focus of most of these books
will be on the mechanics of leading. But leadership is more than the act of leading.
Leadership is about the quality of relationships and infl uence.
In The Affi rmation Principle, Dr. Bernard Curtis advances the proposition that
organizations can bring out the best in people and achieve extraordinary success by
understanding how to lead and care for the human spirit. Dr. Curtis begins by presenting
the business case for the importance of organizations to understand the benefi ts of
valuing people. In part one he explores the unstated contract between employees and
employers, describes what organizations must do to connect with their people, and
challenges leaders to have the courage to change. In part two, he shares a new concept
and model of leadership based on human-affi rming behaviors and sound humane
principles. In part three, Dr. Curtis shows how leaders value to the organization can be
measured, how they can become more accountable, and what they can do to bring out
the best in their people.
The Affi rmation Principle offers some keen insights into the leader-follower relationship.
This book provides some new tools to help the serious leader take their leadership thinking
and skills to the next level." />
