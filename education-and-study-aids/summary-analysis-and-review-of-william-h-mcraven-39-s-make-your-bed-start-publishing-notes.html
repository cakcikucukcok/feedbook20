  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of William H. McRaven&#39;s Make Your Bed - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of William H. McRaven&#39;s Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life and Maybe the World includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and a detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Make Your Bed presents ten life lessons William H. McRaven gleaned from his training as a Navy SEAL and his career in the military. Each lesson is illustrated with anecdotes drawn from McRaven&#39;s experiences. The book was inspired by a 2014 commencement address McRaven delivered at the University of Texas, Austin. That speech is reprinted at the end of the volume.
The first lesson is to start each day with a task that can be completed. In SEAL training, McRaven had to make his bed perfectly as soon as he got up. Whatever difficult challenges and failures he faced during the rest of the day, he knew that he had successfully made his bed. That knowledge helped him build courage and self-esteem." />
