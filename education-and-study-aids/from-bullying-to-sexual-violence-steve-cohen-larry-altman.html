  <title>From Bullying to Sexual Violence - Steve Cohen, Larry Altman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2014, the federal government addressed the issue of student victimization through the expansion of Title IX. Every school district, college, and university receiving federal funding is accountable to reduce and ultimately eliminate sexual harassment and sexual violence in their settings.
The requirements are extensive and apply to other forms of discrimination as well, and the consequences for noncompliance for students and schools are significant.
Yet at this time, less than 1% of schools nationwide are in compliance, putting their students and their schools at additional risk.
Ultimately, Title IX compliance will help both students and schools, and so will this book." />
