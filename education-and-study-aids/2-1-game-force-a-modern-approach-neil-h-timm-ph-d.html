  <title>2/1 Game Force a Modern Approach - Neil H. Timm Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 2/1 Game Force bidding system is an improvement over the Standard American
System that has been in effect and played by bridge players for many years. The
advantage of the 2/1 system is that it allows the partnership to know that game is possible
with only a single bid. In this book, I have tried to present the fundamental aspects of the
bidding structure for playing a pure Two-Over-One Game Force system of bidding.
In this book, I have tried to change behavior by presenting a series of bids geared toward
the 2/1 bidding structure that includes Bergen, Reverse Bergen, and Combined Bergen
Raises, inverted minor suit raises with crisscross and flip-flop, cuebidding, modified
scroll bids, and many more methods not used in Standard American or Precision.
In the fourth edition, the Minorwood Convention has been expanded and several variations of the Flannery Convention are included in this edition. I have added the Hello and SCUM conventions
used to interfer over strong notrumps and a Modified Landy convention designed to
compete over partnerships that employ a weak notrump bid. The Equal Level Conversion
(ELC) double is discussed in Chapter 6 and additional material on slam bidding has been
added to Chapter 3. The material on two-way new minor forcing and the Gazilli
Convention has been expanded upon in Chapter 1 and Jacoby transfers with a superaccept
structure has been added to Chapter 2.
Finally, a new chapter that reviews the new Italian System of bids called Fantunes has
been included in this edition. The System has been modified to be in compliance with the
General Convention Chart." />
