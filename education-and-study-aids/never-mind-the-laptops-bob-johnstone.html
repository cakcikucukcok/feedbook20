  <title>Never Mind the Laptops - Bob Johnstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;What we all hope for our children&#39;s education is undiminished curiosity and creativeness, and solid practical preparation for adult work.  Today, there&#39;s no doubt that easy access to computers is vital for students.  Bob Johnstone has brilliantly and passionately told the story of the worldwide struggle to make today&#39;s equivalent of the pencil accessible to all students.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Victor K. McElheny, author of &quot;Watson and DNA&quot;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If every kid had a laptop computer, what would difference would it make to their learning? And to their prospects? Today, these are questions that all parents, teachers, school administrators, and politicians must ask themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Johnstone provides a definitive answer to the conundrum of computers in the classroom. His conclusion: we owe it to our kids to educate them in the medium of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book he tells the extraordinary story of the world&#39;s first laptop school.  How daring educators at an independent girls&#39; school in Melbourne, Australia, empowered their students by making laptops mandatory. And how they solved all the obstacles to laptop learning, including teacher training.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Their example spread to thousands of other schools worldwide. Especially in America, where it inspired the largest educational technology initiative in US history-the State of Maine issuing laptops to every seventh-grader in its public school system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lively, intriguing, anecdote-rich account is based on hundreds of interviews. In it, you&#39;ll meet the visionary leaders, inspirational principals, heroic teachers, and their endlessly-surprising students who showed what computers in the classroom are really for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
