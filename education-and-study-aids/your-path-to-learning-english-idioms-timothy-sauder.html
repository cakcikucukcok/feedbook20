  <title>Your Path to Learning English Idioms - Timothy Sauder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is estimated that about 10 percent of the English language are idioms and phrases. This increases as you watch American TV, from the movies to the news. It is impossible to understand American English without basic knowledge of these phrases. Even Americans do not understand some of the things that are said on their own grams. Second-language people are five times more than native-born English speakers of all countries. This book is a must if you are going to know anything about the English language. Of course I do not cover British English, which has its own idioms and phrases. Every country has its own words and phrases, but in this book we are dealing with American and Canadian English. I hope you enjoy the humor of it as well. Most Canadian jokes are about Americans. This books humor is based on that fact." />
