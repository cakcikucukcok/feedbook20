  <title>Learning from Lincoln: Leadership Practices for School Success - Harvey Alvy, Pam Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What can 21st century educators learn from the example of a 19th century president? In this intriguing and insightful book, Harvey Alvy and Pam Robbins show how the legacy of Abraham Lincoln can guide today&#39;s education leaders--principals, teachers, superintendents, and others--as they tackle large-scale challenges, such as closing the achievement gap, and everyday issues, such as communicating with constituents. The authors identify 10 qualities, attributes, and skills that help to explain Lincoln&#39;s effectiveness, despite seemingly insurmountable odds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Implementing and sustaining a mission and vision with focused and profound clarity&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Communicating ideas effectively with precise and straightforward language&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Building a diverse and competent team to successfully address the mission&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Engendering trust, loyalty, and respect through humility, humor, and personal example&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Leading and serving with emotional intelligence and empathy&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Exercising situational competence and responding appropriately to implement effective change&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. Rising beyond personal and professional trials through tenacity, persistence, resilience, and courage&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. Exercising purposeful visibility&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. Demonstrating personal growth and enhanced competence as a lifetime learner, willing to reflect on and expand ideas&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. Believing that hope can become a reality&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters devoted to each element explore the historical record of Lincoln&#39;s life and actions, then discuss the implications for modern educators. End-of-chapter exercises provide a structure for reflection, analysis of current behaviors, and guidance for future work, so that readers can create their own path to success--inspired by the example of one of the greatest leaders of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This product listing is for the reflowable (ePub) version of the book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
