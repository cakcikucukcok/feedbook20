  <title>Much ADO about Nothing: The 30-Minute Shakespeare - William Shakespeare, Nick Newlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planning a school or amateur Shakespeare production? The best way to experience the plays is to perform them, but getting started can be a challenge: The complete plays are too long and complex, while scene selections or simplified language are too limited. &quot;The 30-Minute Shakespeare&quot; is a new series of abridgements that tell the â??storyâ? of each play from start to finish while keeping the beauty of Shakespeare&#39;s language intact. Specific stage directions and character suggestions give even inexperienced actors the tools to perform Shakespeare with confidence, understanding, and fun! This cutting of Shakespeare&#39;s utterly charming and popular comedy MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING features five key scenes, including Beatrice and Benedick&#39;s classic initial word-battle, and the uproarious hide-and-seek deception of the two &quot;lovers.&quot; The next scenes are the brutal rejection of Hero at the altar by a deceived Claudio and the timeless manhandling of the English language by the bumbling constable Dogberry. In the fifth and final scene, Shakespeare resolves the play&#39;s conflicts and confusions, and love reigns again. This cutting really tells the story, and includes some sidesplitting stage business, particularly the back-and-forth physical and verbal parrying between Benedick and Beatrice. The edition also includes an essay by editor Nick Newlin on how to produce a Shakespeare play with novice actors, and notes about the original production of this abridgement at the Folger Shakespeare Library&#39;s annual Student Shakespeare Festival." />
