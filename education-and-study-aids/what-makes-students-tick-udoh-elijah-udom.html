  <title>What Makes Students Tick? - Udoh Elijah Udom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The educational system is societys best ally and should not be allowed to break down. Our objective in this study was to identify the causes of high dropout rates and low passion for learning among college students. The common view that students are lazy or lacking interest in education is unfounded. On the contrary, we found that, but for factors beyond their control, most students would work hard to achieve their educational objectives. To avoid the judgmental trap, students were asked to identify the factors that would unlock their passion for learning. The factors identified by the students are analyzed in this book. It is hoped that students, parents, teachers, and school authorities will find this book a light to their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Udoh Elijah Udom&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Students lose interest in education and drop out of school for a number of reasons. Dr. Udom rightly turned to us, the students, to find out the factors that would restore our confidence in the education system and make us enroll and remain in school till graduation. I strongly recommend this book to my fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Joseph J. Brown, Student&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our school system has experienced dramatic developments in recent decades, including low motivation to learn among college students. Dr. Udoms book highlights the causes of students lack of passion for learning and offers recommendations for a sustainable recruitment and retention of students. This book is one of the best that has been written on this topic and is strongly recommended as a reference material. &lt;/p&gt;
