  <title>How to Get Really Good at English - Language Learning Polyglot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Millions of people learn English but only a very small percentage of learners can actually speak it fluently. Why is that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People in general are quick to point out that some are naturally built more than others to learn English and other languages. This is not necessarily true, however, since we have all come to learn and speak our native language fluently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you find yourself overwhelmed trying to study and review thousands of English grammar rules and vocabulary words or are struggling to speak English with native speakers, try this book! This is not a basic English for beginners textbook designed to teach American English or British English but a book that will teach you how to learn English the smart way and get you to fluency faster using highly effective language learning methods and techniques.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There exists hundreds of English language coursebooks, English grammar books, and basic English for beginners textbooks, but without smart language learning techniques and strategies, you are likely to forget what you have studied and reviewed and especially during a conversation. There exists an easier and more fun way to build your overall English language ability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;How to Get Really Good at English&lt;/em&gt;, discover how you can easily conquer the English language using highly effective methods and strategies used by polyglots (language learning experts). This includes both American English and British English. These methods and techniques can even be used to learn English grammar, vocabulary, and phrases from TV shows, movies, videos, music, and video games.&lt;br /&gt;
