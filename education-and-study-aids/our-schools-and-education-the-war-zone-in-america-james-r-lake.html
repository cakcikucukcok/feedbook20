  <title>Our Schools and Education: the War Zone in America - James R. Lake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the ongoing saga of bureaucratic control, misuse of money and personnel, lies, and failures, not of the children but of the leaders, educators,and businesses that control education, author James Lake firmly presents the truth versus the ideology in this comprehensive book. Throughout &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Schools and Education: The War Zone in America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, he includes the problems bureaucrats create and what we can do to reclaim our schools. He shows workable and realistic solutions to help answer the pressing problems facing our children.  He invites everyone, teachers, parents, and the young and old, to be part of the positive effort instead of adding to the existing dilemma buy doing nothing, allowing the bureaucrats to continue to control massive amounts of money meant to help our youth.  This book is an eye-opener and should be read by every American that believes in the educational traditions that have made our nation great.  With the help of teachers, parents and communities we can set aside the educational socialism forced upon us by Washingto D.C. and revers our present direction, returning education to our communities.  We must maintain the America that our parents knew and created and not succumb to being a one world government.  We will teach our youth to love America and to cherish our history and what America has stood for.  The key to this is our support for what is right for our children and our nation.  Our schools must teach the three &quot;Rs&quot; but also history, science, the arts, technology, vocational classes, and give our youth a very broad and realistic education.  We must not teach to a test nor national standards.  This book exposes the problems and gives answers to the needed solutions that every parent and teacher should be aware and active in their implementation.  &lt;b&gt;&gt;i&gt;Our Schools and Education: The War Zone in America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; identifies the problems and presents the solutions to these issues so that educational socialism will be done away with and our communities will once again control and direct our schools, reestablishing and maintaining the greatness that has been our nations.  May God bless America." />
