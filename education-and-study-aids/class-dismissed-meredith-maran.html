  <title>Class Dismissed - Meredith Maran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This gripping story -a year in the lives of three high school seniors and their school-takes us deep into the hearts and minds of American teenagers, and American society, today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seniors of Berkeley High are the white, black, Latino, Asian, and multiracial children of judges and carpenters, software consultants and garbage collectors, housewives and housekeepers. Some are Harvard bound; others are illiterate. They are the Class of 2000, and through the lives of three of them &lt;i&gt;Class Dismissed &lt;/i&gt;brings us inside the nation&#39;s most diverse high school-where we glimpse the future of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn was ten when her father abandoned her family; since then she&#39;s been helping her mother raise her two little brothers and keep food on the table-while keeping her grades up so she can go to college. Her faith in God gives Autumn strength, but who will give her the money she needs when she&#39;s offered the opportunity of a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside, Jordan&#39;s life looks perfect. He hangs out with the &quot;rich white kids&quot;; rows on the crew team, has a cool mom, applied early to an East Coast college. But Jordan&#39;s drug-addicted father died last year, leaving Jordan reeling with grief and anger that makes his life feel anything but perfect-and his future suddenly seem uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third-generation Berkeley High student, Keith is bright and popular, a talented football player who hopes to play college ball and one day, go pro. But Keith has a reading problem that threatens his NFL dream. And the Berkeley police have a problem with Keith that threatens his very freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking into the lives of these young people, in this American town, at this time in history, we see more than what&#39;s true---and what&#39;s possible--for Berkeley High. We see what&#39;s true and what&#39;s possible for America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
