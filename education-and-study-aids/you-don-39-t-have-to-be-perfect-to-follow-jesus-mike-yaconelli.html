  <title>You Don&#39;t Have to Be Perfect to Follow Jesus - Mike  Yaconelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you hear the word &lt;em&gt;disciple&lt;/em&gt;, you may envision people who spend all day praying and converting the masses. Or individuals who have a natural holiness deep inside. The truth is, being a follower of Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t a job for the perfect or the Christian elite&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s something anyone can and should be. (And even the original twelve disciples were far from perfect!) This thirty-day devotional looks at the traits &lt;em&gt;real, &lt;/em&gt;very humandisciples have, using Scripture, first-person comments from teens, and questions that help you think about your own disciple experiences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think of Peter, John, Matthew, and even Paul, they seem to be heroes for Jesus&amp;mdash;the ones we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to emulate and be more like. After all, Jesus handpicked them to be his followers and ambassadors on earth, and trusted them with everything when he left, so they &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;have been really holy men, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you read the Gospels and Acts closely, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice the men Jesus called into his ministry were often clueless, selfish, afraid, and brash, and made a lot of mistakes during their time as disciples. In other words, they were very human. Just like you. This 30-day devotional peels back the holy veneer and explores the character traits that mark all disciples&amp;mdash;things like fear, boldness, doubt, laziness, weakness, sensitivity, brokenness, alienation, hunger, immaturity, strength, and preparedness&amp;mdash;and uses Scripture, real-world examples, and questions with space to journal to help you see these &amp;ldquo;negative&amp;rdquo; qualities actually qualify you to follow Jesus. Because discipleship isn&amp;rsquo;t something from the first century, and Jesus is calling you to follow him today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Don&#39;t Have to Be Perfect to Follow Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;can be used for personal study or in a group setting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is ideal for teens and young adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;contains short readings, with full Scripture passages included, that you can take with you anywhere&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;breaks down the real truth behind Scripture to show how it applies to your life today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
