  <title>Christian Identity Formation - Lenkwane Mathunyane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book covers an overview of the Bible teachings, as advocated by the Christian doctrine. 
The contemporary Lutheranism reflects on subjects such as freedom, tolerance, politics, visual arts and technology; proliferation of new cults and practises, as factors affecting Christianity. 
The purpose of this book, amongst others, is to revive and rekindle the Christian belief and the Bible teachings about salvation, justification, faith and grace; with a special focus on the contemporary Lutheran way of worshipping and concurring with Luthers views on the themes: 
 Singing and dancing for Christ only 
 Christian identity formation 
 The only God of Order 
 The only Prayer 
 The only Word 
 The only workshop of God 
 The only chief Commissioner 
 The only free Holy gift 
 The only Grace-One faith 
 The only Cross-The atonement 
 The only Way-The grace filled water 
 The only Salvation-The bread and wine 
An in depth understanding of the themes outlined, will encourage, and motivate Lutheran-Christians to allocate themselves more time to read, hear and gain knowledge about the gospel and the Lutheran theology. 
The approach employed, is didactically oriented, resourceful and useful, especially for the youth and their teachers." />
