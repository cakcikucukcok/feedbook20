  <title>Bullet Point - Peter Abrahams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wyatt never really thought much about his dad&amp;#8212;a hardened criminal, a lifer in a prison somewhere on the other side of the state. But then the economy had to go and tank, and the community had to go and cut the baseball program from Wyatt&#39;s high school. And then the coach had to go and show Wyatt a photograph of his dad at sixteen, looking very much like Wyatt himself. Through a series of unfortunate&amp;#8212;or perhaps they were fortunate&amp;#8212;events, Wyatt meets a crazy-hot girl named Greer with a criminal dad of her own. A criminal dad who is, in fact, in jail with Wyatt&#39;s own criminal dad. Greer arranges a meeting, and Wyatt&#39;s dad is nothing like the guy he&#39;s imagined&amp;#8212;he&#39;s suave, and smart, and funny, and cool, and&amp;#8212;Wyatt&#39;s pretty sure&amp;#8212;innocent. So Wyatt decides to help him out. A decision that may possibly be the worst he&#39;s ever made in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another hold-your-breath thriller by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling and Edgar Award nominated Peter Abrahams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
