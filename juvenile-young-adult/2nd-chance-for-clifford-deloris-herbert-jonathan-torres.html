  <title>2Nd Chance for Clifford - Deloris Herbert, Jonathan Torres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clifford is a kind, caring young boy loved and valued by his whole family and close friends at school. Very talented, an all-rounder who excels in everything he does. His teacher Mrs. Powell always said what a kind boy he was, very down to earth and loved encouraging other children to work hard. Good at athletics, his best sports would always be football!.
If another child ever felt sad at school, Clifford would show you a kind hand, smile, and invite you to come and play. Every day was a fun-packed day, happy faces, delightful children with great imaginations. Clifford never expected to be surrounded by a group of bullies that day, who were mean and very cruel. They judged him because he was different from them, his skin tone and the texture of his hair. This made him question himself, feeling sad and uncomfortable. 
His family and the headmaster at school tried to make the situation better, but the damage was already set in place. Cliffords parents, Anita and Sinclair, decided enough was enough it was about Cliffords well-being and what change they had to make. Clifford found a new adventures place, a new school not so far away. Somewhere safe that practices the golden rules every single day. Clifford is the happiest boy he has ever been, he now understands to be different, is unique blue print of himself.
Clifford has found his purpose in life! To help other children who struggle with confidence. His message to all children show kind hands, dont judge! Most people are not a perfect image of yourself. Clifford and Max are close friends out of school; they spend most of their time encouraging children to speak out." />
