  <title>Gorky Rises - William Steig, William Steig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One fresh and fair summer day, as soon as his parents go out, Gorky sets up his laboratory by the kitchen sink to have another try at concocting a magic potion. This time he strikes upon the missing ingredient--half a bottle of his mother&#39;s attar of roses--and he knows it&#39;s success at last.&lt;br&gt;While he is waiting for the bubbly, glinting liquid to show what it can do, he heads over to Elephant Rock, &quot;his best spot for doing nothing.&quot; But on the way he stops to bask in the sun, soon falls asleep--and wakes to find himself floating in the immensely blue sky, clutching his bottle of magic.&lt;br&gt;There follows the most astonishing, bewildering, and bedazzling adventure a young frog could possibly have. Orbiting the globe has its ups and downs, however, and Gorky soon begins to wonder if he&#39;ll ever get back to earth. He does manage to outwit the magic; but the potion saves a last surprise until Gorky reaches Elephant Rock, just on day later than he had planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorky Rises is a 1980 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year, Notable Children&#39;s Book of the Year, and Outstanding Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
