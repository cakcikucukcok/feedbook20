  <title>THE DOG OF MONTARGIS - A French Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 409&lt;br /&gt;
In this 409th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE DOG OF MONTARGIS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is often said that &amp;ldquo;A dog is man&amp;rsquo;s best friend.&amp;rdquo; This is no more true than in this 14th century legend, which has survived in a letter by J. C. Scaliger a 14th C. scholar and physician.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A knight and favourite of King Charles V, Aubry de Montdidier, is murdered in 1371 by his rival Robert Macaire in the forest near Montargis (125km/78 miles S.E. of Paris.) Aubry&amp;#39;s hound, the only creature that actually witnessed the murder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A friend of Aubry de Montdidier, Sieur de Narsac, goes in search of his friend and finds the emaciated dog of Aubry chained and locked away. He frees the dog and nurses it back to health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the court of King Charles V, the hound succeeds in bringing suspicion on Macaire. Then the king males a momentous decision&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
What was the decision and what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? To find the answers to this question, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story!&lt;br /&gt;
