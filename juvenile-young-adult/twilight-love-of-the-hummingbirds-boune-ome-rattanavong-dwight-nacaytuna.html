  <title>Twilight Love of the Hummingbirds - Boune Ome Rattanavong, Dwight Nacaytuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twilight Love of the Hummingbirds is a short fairy tale, a story of a young couple (husband and wife) that remembered their past lives. They both once were hummingbirds. One day, the husband went out searching for food. While sucking the honey in the flower, he forgot to keep track of the time. The flower folded unexpectedly. He couldnt get out, so he had to spend the night inside the flower. Back home in the nest, his wife thought that he was fooling around and that he had forgotten about her and the chicks.
That same night, there was a tragic fire that burned all the bushes. The wife decided to stay in the nest with her chicks, and she let the fire take their lives. With her last breath, she promised herself that if she were to be given a new life or be reborn on this earth, she would never ever speak to any man again.
God of love sent them back to earth again. This time, they were both born as humans. The wife was born into a royal family as a beautiful princess. The husband was born as a handsome son of a poor farmer in the same kingdom. Time passed; the princess grew up but never ever spoke to any man in the kingdom, including her own father, the king. The royal family was worried that no prince or any person would marry their daughter. The king sent out an announcement: Any young man that his daughter spoke to or talked to, he would be granted to marry her and become his son-in-law. And the search for the prince charming for their daughter began.
This story is exciting and a must-read." />
