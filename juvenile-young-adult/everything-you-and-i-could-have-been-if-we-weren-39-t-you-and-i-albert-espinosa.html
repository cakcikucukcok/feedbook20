  <title>Everything You and I Could Have Been If We Weren&#39;t You and I - Albert Espinosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Can you imagine a future where everyone has given up sleeping?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;From the creator of the television series &lt;I&gt;Red Band Society&lt;/I&gt; and author of the international bestseller &lt;I&gt;The Yellow World&lt;/I&gt; comes this  uniquely special novel.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;What if I could reveal your secrets with just a glance? And what if I  could feel with your heart just by looking at you? And what if --in a  single moment-- I could know that we were made for each other? Marcos  has just lost his mother, a famous dancer who taught him everything, and  he decides that his world can never be the same without her. Just as he  is about to make a radical change, a phone call turns his world upside down.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Albert Espinosa has a peculiar talent for generating immediate  congeniality around him, for shifting people&#39;s moods toward the positive  and for reconciling them with themselves and the world, when needed.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Reviews:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;«Albert Espinosa lives exclusively in his imagination. He uses it to  write, to direct plays and films and to act. His sense of humour is as  special as his way of living. An optimism as contagious as a cold.»&lt;BR&gt;Teresa Cendrós, &lt;I&gt;El Periódico&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;«If there&#39;s one ability Espinosa has had in all of his multifactorial  creations it&#39;s his capacity to stand in other people&#39;s shoes. Empathy is his strength.»&lt;BR&gt;Núria Escur, &lt;I&gt;La Vanguardia&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;«Speaking with Albert teaches me many new things, such as &quot;it is not sad  to die&quot; and that what is sad is not living, not to live it all (...). He  knows what he&#39;s talking about and knows how to tell it, and that&#39;s why his works help us to live.»&lt;BR&gt;Víctor M. Amela, &lt;I&gt;La Vanguardia&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;«Espinosa says what he thinks and feels, taking out any feeling from his  closet in the same manner he sticks out his leg. He knows he is alive  because of a miracle and that life is a short miracle. How I like this  guy. His life, his theatre, his gambles, humour and his courage. There&#39;s no one else like him.»&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Marcos Ordóñez, &lt;I&gt;El País&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;«A militant of life, an engineer of art.»&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Elena Pita, &lt;I&gt;El Mundo&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;«Armoured in the face of pessimism, &lt;I&gt;Everything You and I Could Have Been If We Weren&#39;t You and I&lt;/I&gt; shines with the positive outlook that  that the author projects on everything he does.»&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Belén Guinart, &lt;I&gt;El País&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;«&lt;I&gt;Everything You and I Could Have Been If We Weren&#39;t You and I&lt;/I&gt;  presents a fast, direct, uninhibited, almost gestural style, which is a  machine of empathy for the reader and is not devoid of humour.»&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;El Correo Español&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
