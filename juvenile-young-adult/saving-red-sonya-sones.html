  <title>Saving Red - Sonya Sones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sonya Sones, award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;What My Mother Doesn&amp;#8217;t Know&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;delivers a gripping, funny, and inspiring novel in verse about what happens when the person you set out to save ends up saving &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right before winter break, fourteen-year-old Molly Rosenberg reluctantly volunteers to participate in Santa Monica&amp;#8217;s annual homeless count, just to get her school&amp;#8217;s community service requirement out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she ends up meeting Red, a spirited homeless girl only a few years older than she is, Molly makes it her mission to reunite her with her family in time for Christmas. This turns out to be extremely difficult&amp;#8212;because Red refuses to talk about her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things Molly won&amp;#8217;t talk about either. Like the awful thing that happened last winter. She may never be ready to talk about that. Not to Red, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; to Cristo, the soulful boy she meets while riding the Ferris wheel one afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Molly realizes that the friends who Red keeps mentioning are nothing more than voices inside Red&amp;#8217;s head, she becomes even more concerned about her well-being. How will Molly keep her safe until she can figure out a way to get Red home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sonya Sones&amp;#8217;s inspiring novel, two girls, with much more in common than they realize, give each other a new perspective on the meaning of family, friendship, and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
