  <title>Three Tales for Kids - Ray Neier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Benny and Clyde, a pair of field mice, are tired of the same old meals. They decide to go out to find something new to eat, a decision that turns into a great adventure. What starts out as a simple trek turns into a life-threatening odyssey as the pair attempts to dodge their natural enemies and return home with their lives and a strawberry as their prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sammy is a squirrel who lives in the city. This is only his third summer, so he still has a lot to learn. Hell soon get his chance. When his friend Hopper the Robin tells him of a mulberry tree located five streets away, Sammy becomes excited. Getting to the mulberry tree and then back home will be a piece of cake, he thinks. But run-ins with cars, dogs, and cats may change his mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally has wanted a puppy for as long as she can remember. Her dad says she can have a puppy, but not until shes more responsible. Shes sure that she has grown more responsible since when they talked last week, but her dad isnt so sure. When Sally finds a tiny kitten in her backyard, she knows that taking care of it will prove if she is responsible enough to take care of a puppy. Will her dad agree? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Tales for Kids was written with young readers in mind. Captivate your children with these imaginative characters and creative adventures of suspense and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
