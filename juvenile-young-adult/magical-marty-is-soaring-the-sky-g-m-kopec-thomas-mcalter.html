  <title>Magical Marty Is Soaring the Sky - G.M. Kopec, Thomas McAlter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Magical Marty is Soaring the Sky is the third story of the Magical Marty Adventure Series where you meet Peter the Eagle.  Soar over the mountains and terrain Magical Marty style!  Oh no!   A storm is on its way.  Is Peter okay?  Check out Magical Marty Soaring the Sky and find out! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In rememberance of three very special babies; Dillon Tedesco ORourke, Abbie Von Opitz, and Jennifer Anne McGowan I wrote a dedication poem entitled: &quot;Your Littlest Angel&quot;.  This poem was specifically written for my sister and two special friends of my family as they have experienced the passing of their babies.  I love them, I wanted them to know that I did not forget their loss and I am humbled by the experience.  Sending my love to them and to all families who have experienced loss of little ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Engage young children to read again by experiencing the Magical Marty Reading Adventures.  Reading to children fifteen minutes a day is a proven activity that encourages children to become life long readers!&lt;BR&gt;
Preschool and early elementary children will enjoy these wacky adventures with humor thrown in and still remember the focused content.&lt;BR&gt;
Friendship and imagination is fun when exploring a Magical Marty Reading Adventure!&lt;BR&gt;
