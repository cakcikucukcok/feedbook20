Wonderful!&amp;#34;&amp;#8212;Nikki must travel through the underworld to be reunited with the love of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Nikki Beckett watched as her boyfriend, Jack, sacrificed himself to save her, taking her place in the dark Tunnels of the Everneath for eternity, she&amp;#39;s been living a borrowed life. Desperate for answers, Nikki turns to Cole, the immortal bad boy who wants to make her his queen&amp;#8212;and the one person least likely to help. But his heart has been touched by everything about Nikki, and he agrees to help in the only way he can: by taking her to the Everneath himself. Nikki and Cole descend into the Everneath, only to discover that their journey will be more difficult than they&amp;#39;d anticipated&amp;#8212;and more deadly. But Nikki vows to stop at nothing to save Jack&amp;#8212;even if it means making an incredible sacrifice of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Persephone myth, the captivating first book in this series, &lt;em&gt;Everneath&lt;/em&gt;, earned a VOYA Perfect Ten of 2011 and a Whitney Award!&lt;/p&gt;" />
