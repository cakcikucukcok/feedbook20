  <title>WASHER THE RACCOON - 16 Escapades and Adventures of Washer the Raccoon - George Ethelbert Walsh, Illustrated by Milo Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all little boys and girls who love animals. Come into the woods and let us listen and watch, and I promise you it will be worthwhile&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WASHER the RACCOON is brave and fearless in danger, and so lovable that you won&amp;rsquo;t lay down this book without saying wistfully, &amp;ldquo;I almost wish I had him really and truly as a friend and not just a story-book acquaintance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we read of Washer&amp;rsquo;s first adventures and how he was carried to the wolf&amp;rsquo;s den and looked after by mother wolf who saves washer&amp;rsquo;s life. Later she adopts Washer. As in all such situations there comes a time when Washer learns he is not a wolf. He is initiated into the wolf pack but saves the life of a fellow raccoon. We also read of how Black Wolf defies the pack and of Washer&amp;rsquo;s journey to the silver birch grove. Later Washer is freed by strangers and after wandering about the forest, is reunited with his mother and brothers.&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is sure to keep you and your young ones enchanted for hours, if not because of the quantity, then their quality. They will have you coming back for more time and again.&lt;br /&gt;
