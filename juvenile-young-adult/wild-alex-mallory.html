  <title>Wild - Alex Mallory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cade, a teen raised alone in the wilderness, is thrust into civilization in this modern retelling of &lt;em&gt;Tarzan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows the forest better than Cade, who has spent his entire life there, foraging, hunting, and surviving. Raised to believe no one else is left in the world, he is shocked when he encounters Dara, a modern girl on a camping trip in his woods. And when an accident forces him back into society with her, he begins to question his entire life. Together, Cade and Dara attempt to handle their newfound celebrity as the media closes in. But the truth of Cade&amp;#39;s past might be too much for either of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Mallory&amp;#39;s action-packed and romantic tale is told from both Cade&amp;#39;s and Dara&amp;#39;s point of view and is perfect for fans of contemporary and dystopian YA as well as classic survival stories such as &lt;em&gt;Hatchet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tarzan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
