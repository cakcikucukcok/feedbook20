  <title>The Blue Door - Christa J. Kinde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;ZonderKidz launches an exciting supernatural series for kids 11 and up. &lt;EM&gt;The Blue Door&lt;/EM&gt;, the first book in The Threshold Series, introduces Prissie Pomeroy, a teen who discovers she can see what others cannot: angels all around. Even more startling is the surprising secret she uncovers about people she &lt;EM&gt;thought&lt;/EM&gt; she knew. As she wrestles with this unexpected ability she must come to grips with the spiritual battles surrounding her. Especially when she learns she received this gift because God has a unique role for her in his bigger plan. But if she’s to fulfill it, she’ll need faith like never before.&lt;BR&gt;This exciting debut by author Christa Kinde draws on the rapidly growing interest in angel stories, an emerging trend in teen and preteen supernatural novels. Boys and girls alike will appreciate her gifted storytelling that captures their imagination with things beyond human sight. And parents will appreciate the family-friendly tone and godly messages maintained throughout this intriguing tale of adventure and spiritual warfare.&lt;/P&gt;" />
