      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Herdmans plus Halloween have always spelled disaster. Every year these six kids -- the worst in the history of Woodrow Wilson School, and possibly even the world -- wreak havoc on the whole town.

There won&#39;t be any Herdmans to contend with this year, but there won&#39;t be any candy, either. And what&#39;s Halloween without candy? And without trick-or-treating? The Herdmans manage to turn the worst Halloween ever into the best Halloween ever in this uproarious sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Best Christmas Pageant Ever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
