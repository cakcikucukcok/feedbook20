  <title>The Adventures of Gabby and Bella - Linda Gustoso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no reason for anyone to be bullied by anyone because of their race, beliefs or choices. Every person deserves respect in what and how they choose to live. It is a personal matter and Bullying is no longer acceptable. When children/adults are intimidated, persecuted, and tormented for their beliefs, and choices it is time we say, Enough! This book hopes to convey to children that they do not have to be a victim and to feel free talk to their Mom and Dad, or Teacher, or any adult they may trust to tell them if they see someone getting bullied including themselves. Bullies do not have the right to hit, and beat anyone because they may be different or have different beliefs and choices. It is not their right to bring down and hurt these victims. This book is to educate and convey to children that there is strength in numbers. They can suggest a Bully Club for their schools with the safety of their teachers and adults, where the child will be anonymous. Enough is Enough ~ Bye Bye Bullies, Bye Bye! We are going to bring you down!" />
