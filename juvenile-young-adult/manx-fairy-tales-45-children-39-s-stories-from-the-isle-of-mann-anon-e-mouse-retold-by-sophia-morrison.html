  <title>MANX FAIRY TALES - 45 Children&#39;s Stories from the Isle of Mann - Anon E. Mouse, Retold by Sophia Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THERE is at least one spot in the world where Fairies are still believed in, and where, if you look in the right places, they may still be found, and that is the little island from which these stories come Elian Vannin, or the Isle of Mann.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But they are never called Fairies by the Manx, instead &amp;nbsp;they are called the Little People. These Little People are not the tiny creatures with wings who flutter about in many European Fairy tales, but they are small persons from two to three feet in height, much like Ireland&amp;rsquo;s leprechauns &amp;ndash; and why not? Ireland is but a ferry-ride away across the Irish Sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are 45 fairy and folk tales about the other-worldly, Little People of the Isle of Mann. The stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
Themselves&lt;br /&gt;
The Buggane&amp;nbsp; Of Glen Meay Waterfall&lt;br /&gt;
How The Manx Cat Lost Her Tail&lt;br /&gt;
The Making Of Mann&lt;br /&gt;
The Coming&amp;nbsp; Of Saint Patrick&lt;br /&gt;
How The Herring Became King Of The Sea&lt;br /&gt;
The Silver Cup&lt;br /&gt;
The Child Without A Name&lt;br /&gt;
The Fairy Doctor&lt;br /&gt;
Joe Moore&amp;rsquo;s Story&amp;nbsp; Of Finn Maccooilley&amp;nbsp; And The Buggane&lt;br /&gt;
The Fynoderee &amp;ndash; An Old Song&lt;br /&gt;
The Fynoderee Of Gordon&lt;br /&gt;
The Lhondoo And The Ushag-Reaisht&lt;br /&gt;
Billy Beg, Tom Beg, And The Fairies&lt;br /&gt;
The Lazy Wife&lt;br /&gt;
The Mermaid Of Gob Ny Ooyl&lt;br /&gt;
The Lost Wife Of Ballaleece&lt;br /&gt;
Smereree&lt;br /&gt;
Kebeg&lt;br /&gt;
The Fairy Child&amp;nbsp; Of Close Ny Lheiy&lt;br /&gt;
The Little Footprints&lt;br /&gt;
The Tall Man Of Ballacurry&lt;br /&gt;
Ned Quayle&amp;rsquo;s Story Of The Fairy Pig&lt;br /&gt;
Scene: A Village&lt;br /&gt;
Kitterland&lt;br /&gt;
Teeval,&amp;nbsp; Princess Of The Ocean&lt;br /&gt;
The Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Palace&lt;br /&gt;
The Enchanted Isle&lt;br /&gt;
Three Stories About Birds&lt;br /&gt;
The Moddey Doo&amp;nbsp; Or The&amp;nbsp; Black Dog Of Peel Castle&lt;br /&gt;
Little Red Bird&lt;br /&gt;
Tehi Tegi&lt;br /&gt;
John-Y-Chiarn&amp;rsquo;s Journey&lt;br /&gt;
A Bad Wish&lt;br /&gt;
The Witch&amp;nbsp; Of Slieu Whallian&lt;br /&gt;
The Old Christmas&lt;br /&gt;
The Buggane&amp;nbsp; Of St. Trinian&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br /&gt;
King Magnus Barefoot&lt;br /&gt;
Manannan Mac Y Leirr&lt;br /&gt;
The Cormorant&amp;nbsp; And The Bat&lt;br /&gt;
Caillagh-Ny-Faashagh,&amp;nbsp; Or The Prophet Wizard&lt;br /&gt;
The City Under Sea&lt;br /&gt;
An Ancient Charm&amp;nbsp; Against The Fairies&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is said the little people of Mann wear red caps and green jackets and are very fond of hunting indeed they are most often seen on horseback followed by packs of little hounds of all the colours of the rainbow. They are rather inclined to be mischievous, and sometimes spiteful, and that is why they are called by such good names, in case they should be listening!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you look hard enough, you may also find the Fynoderees and the Bugganeswho are totally different to the Little People..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So download this eBook and sit back with a steaming hot beverage and be prepared to be entertained for hours.&lt;br /&gt;
