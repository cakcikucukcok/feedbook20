  <title>Jellybean - Eva Patton, Gil Balbuena Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Long ago, Dogma told me and my littermates there comes a time when every puppy must have his very own family. Dogs are loved by people for many reasons, and it is one of the most wonderful things in the entire world when a human pack or family comes to our kennel to find some of its happiness. A puppy is very lucky to be matched up with his own person or family who will love him forever.
With these thoughts, I prayed to Saint Bernard for my very own family. Eventually, they came, and in the fourteen-plus years I shared with them, my life had both wonderful and miserable times. The hardest thing was learning right and wrong. Fortunately, Angelo Wingsandhalo was there to help, and what he said made sense. His archrival, Lucifer Hornsandtail, however, said things that were too good to be ignored. 
If I could remember, did I do what was good, or did I have a good time? 
I am Jellybean.
This is my story.
Not a word of this is untrue." />
