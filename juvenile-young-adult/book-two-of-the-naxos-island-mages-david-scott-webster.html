      <meta name="description" content="Journey along with Stephunos and his friends as they continue to explore their new home on Naxos Island. The mystical creatures of legend are now part of Stephunos&#39; everyday life. A life that could only be described as hectic since his twelfth birthday nearly three months ago is finally beginning to return to some degree of normalcy. Stephunos has to take on new responsibilities as he and his friends are allowed to explore the strange green caves they had discovered. To his great pleasure, and against his little brother&#39;s wishes, school is beginning. Besides their normal school lessons, they will continue their lessons with Dragos, the talking dragon, and start some new lessons with other unique telepathic animals. Life seems peaceful.
&lt;p&gt;
Unbeknownst to them the Dark Mages, having been defeated in their attempt to destroy the people of Naxos Island, have other plans. The leader of the Dark Mages&#39;, Cosmin, anger grows as he sets his plans of conquest into motion. He is determined to exterminate the people and creatures of Naxos Island by any means. Fed by his ever-increasing anger, Cosmin will not rest until he controls the entire planet. War is on the horizon!" />
