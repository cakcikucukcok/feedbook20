  <title>The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Boar - Claus Koch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone knows the story of the three little pigs but few know the complementary story of how three friendly little wolves were persecuted by the Big Bad Boar. A few stories have attempted to right this egregious wrong but none have told the all encompassing story of how these clever little wolves performed miraculous feats of daring-do while being hounded by the Big Bad Boar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you&#39;ve ever wondered: &lt;br /&gt;
Where did the Unicorn come from? &lt;br /&gt;
How did Prince Charming really get past those roses to kiss Sleeping Beauty? &lt;br /&gt;
What are the ingredients to make Seven League Boots? And &lt;br /&gt;
How do you break witches&#39; spells? &lt;br /&gt;
Then find the answers while you read how Three Little Wolves undid witches spells, used enchanted robins to make magic boots, outsmarted a selfish king and saved his castle from the big bad boar." />
