  <title>THE BLACK DOUGLAS - A Legend of Scotland - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 305&lt;br /&gt;
In this 305th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of Sir James Douglas also known as &amp;ldquo;THE BLACK DOUGLAS&amp;rdquo;. This is a story from one of the most turbulent periods in British history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sir James Douglas (also known as Good Sir James and the Black Douglas c. 1289 &amp;ndash; August 1330) was a Scottish knight and feudal lord. He was one of the chief commanders during the Wars of Scottish Independence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was the eldest son of Sir William Douglas, known as &amp;quot;le Hardi&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the bold&amp;quot;, who had been the first noble supporter of William Wallace. His mother was Elizabeth Stewart. Sir William died a prisoner in the Tower of London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Douglas was sent to France for safety in the early days of the Wars of Independence, and was educated in Paris. There he met William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. He returned to Scotland with Lamberton. His lands had been seized and awarded to Robert Clifford. Lamberton presented him at the occupying English court to petition for the return of his land shortly after the capture of Stirling Castle in 1304, but when Edward I of England heard whose son he was he grew angry and Douglas was forced to depart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now facing a life as a landless outcast on the fringes of feudal society, the return of his ancestral estates was to become an overriding obsession, inevitably impacting on his political allegiances. Douglas met and offered his services to Robert the Bruce and the rest as they say is history. In this case it really is&amp;hellip;.. You&amp;#39;re invited to download and read this true story of the Black Douglas and add it to your collection of Baba Indaba Stories for Children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
