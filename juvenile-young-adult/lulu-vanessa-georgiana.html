  <title>Lulu - Vanessa Georgiana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lulu is a tiny, unique spider who sees the beauty within everyone. Determined to never judge others by their looks but instead by their hearts and souls, Lulu goes about his days playing hide-and-seek with his sisters and brothers. With a white stripe down his blue back, only five black eyes, and eight legs, Lulu knows he looks different than the rest of his family, but that is okay. Lulu loves himself from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lulu begins his first day of school, he is very excited to make new friends. But when he arrives at school, everyone ignores him, including his teacher. All the excitement about school begins to fade away. Day after day, Lulu is bullied, called names, and overlooked by everyone. But even as Lulu battles prejudice at school, there is even more tension at home. After Lulus father abandons them and his mother falls ill, Lulu must face the reality that those who do not understand, judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lulu is the poignant tale of a positively unique spider who, despite all of lifes hardships, holds onto the faith that everyone will one day see that we are all exceptionalon Earth and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;" />
