  <title>Mokie and Bik - Wendy Orr, Jonathan Bean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Mokie and Bik&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mokie and Bik lived on a boat called Bullfrog. They lived in it, on it, all around it--monkeying up ladders and down ropes, over the wheelhouse and across the cabin floor. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Twins!&quot; their mother shouted, because the lines of her Art jiggled and jarred when Mokie and Bik played bumpboats. &quot;Get out from underfoot!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So Bik bumped Mokie out the door--splat!--into nanny Ruby&#39;s bucket as she was sploshing the deck.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Twins!&quot; shouted Ruby. &quot;Get out from underfoot!&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So they sunned like seals on the wheelhouse roof for about twenty hours till Ruby finished sploshing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet a pair of twins that will monkey their way into your heart!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mokie is bigger but Bik is faster. They are twins, and they have a nanny Ruby that looks after them while their mom is Arting and their dad is on his ship at sea. &lt;br&gt;Whether they&#39;re helping Erik the Viking splosh his decks or learning to swim fast as fisk, these two are always overboard or underfoot! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rambunctious and charming, Mokie and Bik are a pair you won&#39;t soon forget. Wendy Orr&#39;s buoyant language and Jonathan Bean&#39;s gorgeous, detailed pen-and-ink illustrations blend together in a book that is destined to become a classic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mokie and Bik&lt;/i&gt; is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
