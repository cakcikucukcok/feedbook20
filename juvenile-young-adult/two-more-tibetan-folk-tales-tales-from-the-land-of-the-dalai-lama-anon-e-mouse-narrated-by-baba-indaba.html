  <title>TWO MORE TIBETAN FOLK TALES - tales from the land of the Dalai Lama - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 443&lt;br /&gt;
In this 443rd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates two Tibetan Fairy Tales.&lt;br /&gt;
The first is &amp;ldquo;The Man and the Ghost&amp;rdquo; and the second &amp;ldquo;How The Rabbit Killed The Lion.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In our first tale we read of a man walking along a remote mountain path when he met a ghost. Despite his fear of the ghost he did not show and presently they journeyed on together conversing and learning more about each other.&lt;br /&gt;
Presently they came to a city and this is when pandemonium ensued&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what actually happened? Was the man recognised as a ghost and did he frighten the people? Or did the actual ghost run amok?&lt;br /&gt;
In our second story, a long time ago when there were no mountains and the sun scorched the earth, every morning the Lion, the King of the Beasts appeared and all the animals had to come and kowtow (bow) before him. Except one day the rabbit decided he would no longer do this.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next? Did the Lion notice, and if he did what would he do about it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How did everything turn out in the end? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read these stories to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
