  <title>Merriol and the Lord Hycarbox - Jennifer Hashmi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How does the Lord of the Environment react when he hears of school children turning to extortion, or of wilful neglect of animals or people, or of children sick as a result of industrial waste? In these stories he gets involved! Merriol is kept very busy in the work of restoring the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lord Hycarbox is the Lord of the Environment, responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Earth. Merriol, his energetic helper, travels down to the people below and records their deeds. These stories begin with a wrong being done to them or their community. The morals that arise as a result are simple to understand and possible for all people young or old to incorporate into their lives This book is well suited for parents to read to a young audience as well as for older children to enjoy on their own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-US Review of Books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a work instilled with important teachings and valuable life lessons. Hashmi has woven the elemental themes of spirituality, nature, and humanity into an intricate and thought-provoking tapestry of engaging children&#39;s literature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
