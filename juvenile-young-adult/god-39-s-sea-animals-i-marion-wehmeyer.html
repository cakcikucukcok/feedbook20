  <title>God&#39;s Sea Animals I - Marion Wehmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
God&#39;s universe is so astonishing that we would be missing a great deal of life if we chose to ignore any part of His creation. Most of us are aware of the many animals that live in the forest and roam the land. A lot less of us are aware of God&#39;s animals that live beneath the sea. It is with this in mind that I decided to share my undersea experience with all of God&#39;s children.
&lt;p&gt;
It is my hope that this book can be used by Christian parents to interact with their children in a way that will expose God&#39;s undersea world and at the same time teach some  Christian values that will have enduring ramifications.
&lt;p&gt;
By asking the questions on each page, we as parents can stimulate our children to think about &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Christ&quot; and His world. We can communicate with our children, and share some interesting life forms with them. 
&lt;p&gt;
It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Each picture within this book is an authentic sea animal. I took all of the pictures of these sea animals as they appeared in their natural environment.
&lt;p&gt;
Each picture represents an extended effort as a scuba diver and underwater photographer. Each animal was handled with loving care and  was not removed from its environment. Look at each picture and use your imagination to stimulate your child&#39;s curiosity.
&lt;p&gt;
This book is intended to be used as a guide to stimulate your child&#39;s interest in His world and as a tool for you to listen to what your child has to say. Please read it to your child and use the information provided with each picture to answer you child&#39;s questions.
&lt;p&gt;
As you read this book, may you enjoy God&#39;s undersea world and remember you are loved by Him always and forever.
