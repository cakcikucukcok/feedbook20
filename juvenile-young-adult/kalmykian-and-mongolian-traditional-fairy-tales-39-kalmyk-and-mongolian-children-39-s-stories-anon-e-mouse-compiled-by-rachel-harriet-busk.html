  <title>KALMYKIAN and MONGOLIAN TRADITIONAL FAIRY TALES - 39 Kalmyk and Mongolian Children&#39;s Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Rachel Harriet Busk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 39 Kalmyk-Mongolian children&amp;rsquo;s fairy and folktales which are Mongolian in origin. Herein you wind stories like:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Saga Of The Well-And-Wise-Walking Khan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Woman Who Sought Her Husband In The Palace Of Erlik-Khan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Gold-Spitting Prince&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Five To One&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;The Wife Who Loved Butter&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bh&amp;icirc;xu Life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Saga Of Ardschi-Bordschi And Vikram&amp;acirc;ditja&amp;rsquo;s Throne&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;The Voice-charmer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How Naran Gerel swore falsely and yet told the Truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;hellip;.plus many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
Kalmyk folklore and fairytales &amp;nbsp;omens and sayings are a little-researched genre of folklore. Since early times the Kalmyk people, surveyed nature, animals, and the birds around them, from which they created tales, legends, myths, songs, proverbs, and sayings that are notable for their keen observation, which, over time, have been infused with a healthy dose of deep wisdom, which is highly complementary to their commonly held practise of Tengric Bhuddism, or Mongolian Buddhism.&lt;br /&gt;
The Kalmyk people are members of the Oirat clan which is Mongolian in origin. The Kalmyks (also spelled Kalmouk) migrated 3,700km/2,300miles from the steppes of southern Siberia on the banks of the Irtysh River to the Lower Volga region, bordering on the northern Caspian sea, arriving in about 1630AD. The most compelling reason was to escape the growing dominance of the neighboring Dzungar Mongol tribe.&lt;br /&gt;
Along the route of their migration, the Kalmyks would have met and mixed with &amp;nbsp;pagans and shamans, the Jewish Khazars, Islam from the Alans and Nogais, and Christianity from the Russians and other Slavic tribes. As such their folklore and fairytales are interwoven with elements of all these cultures creating a rich and diverse tapestry of lore which is reflected in this volume.&lt;br /&gt;
