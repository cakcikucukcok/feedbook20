  <title>Argos - Ralph Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a compelling new voice in middle grade literature comes a reimagination of &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey &lt;/em&gt;told from the point of view of Odysseus&amp;#8217;s loyal dog. &lt;em&gt;Argos &lt;/em&gt;is a thrilling tale of loyalty, determination, and adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For twenty years, the great hero Odysseus struggles to return to Ithaka. After ten years beneath the walls of Troy, he begins the long journey back home. He defeats monsters. He outsmarts the Cyclops. He battles the gods. He does whatever it takes to reunite with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what of that family&amp;#8212;his devoted wife, Penelope; his young son, Telemachos; his dog, Argos? For those twenty years, they wait, unsure whether they will ever see Odysseus again. But Argos has found a way to track his master. Any animal who sets foot or wing on Ithaka brings him news of Odysseus&amp;#8217;s voyage&amp;#8212;and what a voyage it is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tales bring hope that one day his master will return. Meanwhile, Argos watches over his master&amp;#8217;s family and protects them from the dangers that surround a throne without its king. This rousing story of devotion and determination is an original take on one of the most beloved myths of all time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
