  <title>ENGLISH FAIRY AND OTHER FOLK TALES - 74 illustrated children&#39;s stories from Old England - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled &amp; Retold by Edwin Hartland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein you will find 74 illustrated children&amp;rsquo;s stories from Old England. This is a collection of fairy tales, folk tales and other stories categorised into Ghosts, Goblins, Fairies, Historical and Legends, Nursery Tales, Giants, and Witchcraft. Tales include, The Haunted House, The Witch And The Toad, The Fairy Thieves, The Fairy Funeral, Jack And The Bean-Stalk, The Legend Of The Sons Of The Conqueror, The Blinded Giant, The Demon Tregeagle, The Haunted Widower, Spectre-Dogs, The Wise Fools Of Gotham, and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These tales serve to justify the title of &amp;ldquo;Merrie England&amp;rdquo;, a title which in older days was given to England, indicating the nation&amp;rsquo;s capacity for fun and humour among the English. The story of Tom Tit Tot, which opens the collection, is unequalled among all other folk-tales, for its combined sense of humour and dramatic power.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So take some time out and travel back to a period before television, or even radio for that matter, when families would gather around a crackling and spitting hearth and granddad or grandma&amp;nbsp; or an uncle or aunt would delight and captivate their audience with stories passed on to them from their mothers, fathers and grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;
=======&lt;br /&gt;
Edwin Sidney Hartland (1848 &amp;ndash; 1927) compiled and authored of works on folklore. His works include anthologies of tales, and theories on anthropology and mythology with an ethnological perspective&lt;br /&gt;
