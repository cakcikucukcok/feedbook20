  <title>Children of Destiny: True Adventures of Three Cultures - Jean M. Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The best way to know about history is to be part of it. The next best way is to read about it and come away feeling as if you had been part of the events and action. Jean Burroughs has selected twelve exciting episodes covering a span of five centuries to bring history to life. Her young heroes and heroines tell their stories from their own personal viewpoints and experiences. They represent the three cultures that are the bedrock of the Southwestern United States society: Native American, Hispanic and Anglo. Each story, based on facts, is preceded by an account of the historical event or incident that forms the basic framework for the tale. Young readers will enjoy reading about the adventures of other children from other cultures and centuries. History comes to life in this series of vignettes of important times in a land that passed from one country to another until it became part of the United States-New Mexico. Illustrations by New Mexico artist, Al Chapman, add drama to the text. JEAN M. BURROUGHS was a First Lady of New Mexico. She is also the author of &quot;Bride of the Santa Fe Trail,&quot; a fictionalized account of the pioneer trip of Susan Shelby Magoffin, also published by Sunstone Press. She has written numerous articles on Southwestern US history and taught Local and Oral History at Eastern New Mexico University. Burrough&#39;s special skill has been able to combine literary creativity with in-depth historical research. The results have brought applause and appreciation from a wide and grateful readership." />
