  <title>Sheroes of the Bible - Lauren L. Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mom, I have a question: why are boys more important than girls? All we ever learn about in church are boys.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This question from Lauren Nelsons 7-year-old daughter led her to write SHEroes of the Bible. She wants young and old to know that God empowered many women in the Bible to do amazing things and He continues to do so today! She especially wants girls to know their importance as daughters of God and that He has a great plan for their lives, just as He does for boys.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHEroes of the Bible takes you on a journey with nine stories of fourteen women from the Old Testament who experienced God in their lives in a significant way. It wasnt easy, but they chose to say yes to God and to trust Him to rescue and comfort them.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God still does amazing things today, and He wants to do them through you! Are you ready to be a SHEro?&lt;/p&gt;" />
