A new fantasy adventure from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Veronica Rossi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For eighteen-year-old Gideon Blake, nothing but death can keep him from achieving his goal of becoming a U.S. Army Ranger. As it turns out, it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovering from the accident that most definitely killed him, Gideon finds himself with strange new powers and a bizarre cuff he can&#39;t remove. His death has brought to life his real destiny. He has become War, one of the legendary four horsemen of the apocalypse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks, he and the other horsemen--Conquest, Famine, and Death--are brought together by a beautiful but frustratingly secretive girl to help save humanity from an ancient evil on the emergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now--bound, bloodied, and drugged--Gideon is interrogated by the authorities about his role in a battle that has become an international incident. If he stands any chance of saving his friends and the girl he&#39;s fallen for--not to mention all of humankind--he needs to convince the skeptical government officials the world is in imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But will anyone believe him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
