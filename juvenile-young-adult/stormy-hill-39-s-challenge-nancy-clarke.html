  <title>Stormy Hill&#39;s Challenge - Nancy Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Part of the continuing series of Stormy Hill novels, Stormy Hill&#39;s Challenge is set in the 1960s on the Stormy Hill horse farm in Lexington, Kentucky. Young Ann has had her moments of glory with her horse, Lightning, more than fulfilling her lifelong dreams. Now her friend Ted has dreams of his own, to do something to make his horse, Si&#39;ad, famous in his own right. Si&#39;ad is already well known as Lightning&#39;s sire, but Ted wants more. When a young couple comes to breed to Si&#39;ad, they discuss the world of endurance racing, a sport in which Arabians excel. What better way to prove Si&#39;ad&#39;s greatness than testing him on the famous Tevis Cup ride in California? Held annually, this 100-mile race follows a trail that climbs mountains and descends into steep, hot canyons, and it must be completed within 24 hours. It would take a year-long commitment to condition Si&#39;ad for such a race, but commitment to his horse is something Ted has in abundance. In the coming year they will know heartbreak, and success will be tested many times, bonding them even stronger. Even Ann is drawn into the sport, and together they set out for the ride of their lives. The endurance motto is: &quot;To finish is to win.&quot; In a race where only half the entrants finish, who will make it to the end?" />
