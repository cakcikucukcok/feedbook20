  <title>Kylee and Lexie - M.H. Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One day, Kylee and her younger sister, Lexie, are playing in the yard at their Grandmas cottage when they discover a very unusual bush.  It sounds like it may be alive; there is a very loud humming sound coming from it.  Burning with curiosity, they decide to investigate the bush; they take a pair of scissors from their Grandmas sewing basket early one morning and tell her that they are going to pick some flowers.
Once they cut away part of the bush, they discover a magical creature that looks a little like a bird but is very different indeed.  He tells them his name is Gomo, and he is a Gholdee.  They meet his friend Vinista, who is invisible at first but then reveals herself to them.  They soon find out that the Gholdees fear humans, so they set out to show them that there is nothing to fear.
At the same time as this discovery, their not-so-nice neighbor stops by their home looking for his missing dog, Champ, a big and fluffy St. Bernard.  Is Champ really Mr. Snivelys dog? Will the Gholdees become their friends?  Come along and see on a magical adventure with &lt;i&gt;Kylee and Lexie.&lt;/i&gt;" />
