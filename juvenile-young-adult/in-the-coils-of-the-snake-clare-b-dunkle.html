  <title>In the Coils of the Snake - Clare B. Dunkle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;What is the spell for?&quot; Miranda asked curiously, stepping close beside him to squeeze through the first ring of trees. She didn&#39;t know of any goblin spells that used flowers unless they were crushed like herbs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;   &quot;Do you really want to know?&quot; murmured the elf absently, looking up at the dark crowns of the ancient oaks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;   &quot;Yes,&quot; she said. She had always liked magic. He glanced back down at her then.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;   &quot;It&#39;s for you,&quot; he said. And the instant they passed the great trunks, his hand closed over her wrist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The powerful final volume of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Miranda has waited her whole life to come home to the goblin kingdom, but she never imagined she&#39;d feel so alone there. Her beloved Marak, the center of her world since childhood, has reached the end of his reign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      But Marak didn&#39;t raise a coward. Miranda needs all her courage when a mysterious elf lord takes her prisoner, reigniting an age-old battle. Caught between two hostile races, she becomes their greatest reason for war--and their only hope for a future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      In this final volume of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy, Clare B. Dunkle draws readers deep into her magical realm for one last incredible story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
