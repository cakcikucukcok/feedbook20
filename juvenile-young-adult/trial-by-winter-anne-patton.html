  <title>Trial by Winter - Anne Patton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the final instalment of the Barr Colony series, Dorothy and the Bolton family are settling into life on the prairies after a treacherous journey – first across the Atlantic, and then across the open landscape as they made their way to their homestead in the Barr Colony. But now, winter is approaching. Her mam and dad are fighting, and her dad decides to travel to Edmonton to work for the winter. This leaves Dorothy, her mam, and her sister Lydia to fend for themselves on the harsh prairie, alongside Dorothy’s older brother Frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with many colonists who took land in the west, the Bolton family has no idea the brutal and harsh conditions that will befall them during a winter on the prairie. With Frank off in Battleford getting supplies, Dorothy, Lydia, and Mam attempt to fend for themselves. But no matter what they do, their sod house continues to get colder and colder, and they become desperate for warmth. They must find a way to save themselves, but how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a true story, Anne Patton has created a compelling final chapter to the Bolton family saga.&lt;/p&gt;" />
