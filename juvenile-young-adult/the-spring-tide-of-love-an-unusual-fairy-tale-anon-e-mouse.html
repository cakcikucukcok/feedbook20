  <title>THE SPRING-TIDE OF LOVE - An Unusual Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 354&lt;br /&gt;
In this 354th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE SPRING-TIDE OF LOVE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago and far away, back when the mists of the early twilight were falling, Elsa, a little girl who lived at the woodman&amp;#39;s cottage, was still far from home. She had wandered out in the spring sunshine in search of the bluebells and wild anemones with which the wood abounded, for the child loved the company of the birds and flowers better than the rough play of the boys who were called her brothers.&lt;br /&gt;
The woodman and his wife said she was strange and dreamy, full of curious fancies which they found it hard to understand; but, then, they were not Elsa&amp;#39;s real parents, which might account for their difficulty. They were kind to her, however, in their fashion, and Elsa always tried to remember to obey them; but sometimes she forgot. She had forgotten to-day&amp;mdash;for although the good wife had told her to remain near the cottage, the eagerness of her search for the flowers she loved had led her farther into the wood than she had ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;
The sunlight disappeared, and the darkness seemed to come quite suddenly under the thick branches of the trees; the birds had chanted their last evening song and gone to their nests&amp;mdash;only a solitary thrush sang loudly just overhead; Elsa thought it was warning her to hurry homewards. She turned quickly, taking as she thought the direction of the cottage; but as she was barely seven years old, and felt a little frightened, it is not surprising that she only plunged deeper into the wood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now she found herself in the midst of a great silence; the beautiful tracery of young green leaves through which she had hitherto caught glimpses of the sky had disappeared, and over her head stretched only bare brown branches, between which she saw the shining stars, clear as on a frosty winter&amp;#39;s night. The stars looked friendly, and she was glad to see them, but it was growing dreadfully cold. The plucked flowers withered and fell from her poor little numbed hands, and she shivered in her thin cotton frock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to lost little Elsa? Did the forest protect her or were there mean beasts lurking waiting for her to fall asleep? Well many things happened, some strange and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story and find out for yourselves!&lt;br /&gt;
