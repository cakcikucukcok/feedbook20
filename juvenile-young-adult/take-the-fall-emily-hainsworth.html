  <title>Take the Fall - Emily Hainsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt; in this gripping and evocative tale of one girl unraveling the mystery of her best friend&#39;s murder, from acclaimed author Emily Hainsworth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHO KILLED GRETCHEN MEYER?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear grips the residents of Hidden Falls the night Sonia Feldman and her best friend, Gretchen Meyer, are attacked in the woods. Sonia was lucky to escape with her life, but Gretchen&#39;s body is discovered at the bottom of a waterfall. Beautiful, popular, and seemingly untouchable, Gretchen can&#39;t be gone. Even as Sonia struggles with guilt and confusion over having survived, the whole town is looking to her for information. . . . Could she have seen something that will lead the police to the killer? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the top of the list of suspects is Gretchen&#39;s ex-boyfriend&amp;#8212;and Sonia&#39;s longtime enemy&amp;#8212;Marcus Perez. So when Marcus comes to Sonia for help clearing his name, she agrees, hoping to find evidence the police need to prove he&#39;s the killer. But as Gretchen&#39;s many secrets emerge and the suspects add up, Sonia feels less sure of Marcus&#39;s involvement and more afraid for herself. Could Marcus&amp;#8212;the artist, the screw-up, the boy she might be falling for&amp;#8212;have attacked her? Killed her best friend? And if it wasn&#39;t him in the woods that night . . . who could it have been?&lt;/p&gt;" />
