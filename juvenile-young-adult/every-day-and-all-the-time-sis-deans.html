  <title>Every Day and All the Time - Sis Deans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heartbreaking, honest, and downright funny novel about loss and recovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;She lay pinned in the back seat listening . . . to the sounds of help that had come too late.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months ago a terrible car accident devastated Emily Racine. Not only did she lose her older brother, Jon, but her own injuries prevented her from doing the thing she loved best: dancing. Now, just as Emily is getting on her feet again, she receives another blow: her parents want to sell their house, which they feel is too full of sad memories. But the cellar of this house is the only place where Emily can still feel and speak to Jon--and she can&#39;t bear to lose him twice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily tries hard to prevent the sale, often with humorous results. Yet as the months pass she comes to realize that change may not always be a bad thing. With lots of love and support she finds a way to say good-bye to her brother and her cherished childhood dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turns heartwrenching and hilarious, Sis Deans&#39;s moving novel will resonate long after the last page has been read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
