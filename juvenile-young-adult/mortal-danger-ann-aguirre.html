  <title>Mortal Danger - Ann Aguirre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ann Aguirre&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Mortal Danger&lt;/i&gt;, Edie Kramer has a score to settle with the beautiful people at Blackbriar Academy. Their cruelty drove her to the brink of despair, and four months ago, she couldn&#39;t imagine being strong enough to face her senior year. But thanks to a Faustian compact with the enigmatic Kian, she has the power to make the bullies pay. She&#39;s not supposed to think about Kian once the deal is done, but devastating pain burns behind his unearthly beauty, and he&#39;s impossible to forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one short summer, her entire life changes and she sweeps through Blackbriar, prepped to take the beautiful people down from the inside. A whisper here, a look there, and suddenly . . . bad things are happening. It&#39;s a head rush, seeing her tormentors get what they deserve, but things that seem too good to be true usually are, and soon, the pranks and payback turns from delicious to deadly. Edie is alone in a world teeming with secrets and fiends lurking in the shadows. In this murky morass of devil&#39;s bargains, she isn&#39;t sure who--or what--she can trust. Not even her own mind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
