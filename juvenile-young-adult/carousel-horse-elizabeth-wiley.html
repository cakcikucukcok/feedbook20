  <title>Carousel Horse - Elizabeth Wiley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spirit Horse II is the original of Carousel Horse. No single person is in the book. Each character is a mix of different riders, trainers, and volunteers. Some of the incidents really occurred, but are mixed with others that are similar, and some are fiction. Horses were an integral part of healing for the author, following a high-fever staph infection that left her very disabled. The ranch is a conglomerate of many programs run over the years by the author and other equine therapists. The author, while working with a severely abused horse one day, realized that if that animal could live in the small cage of a stall and still learn to trust her and build a new life, so could the author. That is the basis of Spirit Horse. The healing of the author started a program that has expanded to include working with psychiatrists, therapists, physical therapists, special education teachers, and parents, as well as veterans, first responders and their families. Spirit Horse II has joined Horses4heroes to provide vets ride free, a national effort of many member stables and programs to just provide a calm, peaceful moment in the lives of our veterans and their families to help them as they rebuild their lives after experiencing war. Horse owners, performance barns, and therapy or trail-riding stables are urged to join this project to share with our hometown heroes and their families the healing of horses. Whether just grooming, feeding carrots, or riding, horses have healed the author. Anyone who owns or works with horses is urged to join Horses4heroes and give a moment of your joy to others who surely have earned our help and respect." />
