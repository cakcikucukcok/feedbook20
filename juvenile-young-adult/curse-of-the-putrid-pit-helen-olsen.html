  <title>Curse of the Putrid Pit - Helen Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Junior&#39;s misery begins after he tells the boys in his new scout troop a lie about his camping skills. But what starts out as a normal scout trip turns into a hair-raising adventure as the group faces wild animals, and perhaps even worse, girls who like to play pranks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And Junior&#39;s adventure is only half the story. As the boys hike, Wild Bill, their scout leader, tells the tale of a storytelling girl named Fannie Fibber and the strange disappearances going on in her town. Junior&#39;s own troubles fade into the background as he learns that not only is Fannie forced to wear the frightening Necklace of Honor, but she must also risk a meeting with Swarthog, the goblin king, to rescue the stolen Light of Truth in order to save her fellow townspeople from the &lt;b&gt;Curse of the Putrid Pit&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Come with Fannie Fibber as she learns to be brave and honest at all costs, and follow Junior through his own struggle to be accepted, as the story of Fannie Fibber teaches him how to walk in the light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fannie didn&#39;t want to be the goblin king&#39;s next barbecue. But things didn&#39;t look so good. Her hands and feet were tied with leather straps, and she was perched on top of the slab of rock he used for a throne as the whole goblin nation danced around her and cried:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Toast the human crisp and black,&lt;br&gt;
&#39;til she gives the truth light back!&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their screams echoed in the cathedral-like cavern, the likes of which Fannie had never seen before. Hundreds of goblins with torches and sweaty bodies twisted and jerked around her. Scared, she had to think fast...
