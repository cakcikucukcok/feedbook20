  <title>Homeschooling Tell Me Why:  (All About Ferrets) - Sean Mosley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ferret is a member of the Mustelidae family, this including the Mink, Ermine, Weasel, (sea) Otter, Black-Footed Ferret, Skunk, Fisher, Marten, Badger, Wolverine and the European polecat. The scientific name for this domestic animal is Mustela Putorius Furo and no one is quite sure who his ancestors were. Scientific evidence by blood tests of the ferret has shown traces coming from the European polecat (Mustela Putorius). If the ferret has recently been bred with a European polecat, his bloodline will have much more European polecat blood than a normal ferret has and ferrets bred with the European polecat are not trustworthy pets. Where the ferret originally comes from is still a mystery. Unlike our domestic cats and dogs, the ferret is not, and has never been a wild animal. Although he is closely related to the European polecat, the ferret cannot survive in the wild." />
