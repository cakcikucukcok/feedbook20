  <title>Riding Out the Storm - Sis Deans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zach is riding the Greyhound bus through a snowstorm to visit his older brother Derek, whom he hasn&#39;t seen in seven months. That&#39;s when their parents finally went broke paying Derek&#39;s doctor&#39;s bills and had to give him up as a ward of the state. Nothing--not drawing in his sketchbook, not basketball--lets Zach forget that his brother is living in a mental institution five states away. But surprisingly, sitting next to a talkative teenage girl he nicknames Purplehead starts to take the edge off Zach&#39;s pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompted by a chain of unpredictable events and by the people he meets along the way, Zach&#39;s cynical humor gives us a poignant look at medical insurance and health care systems for the mentally ill, and at the everyday fears, joys, and revelations of adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
