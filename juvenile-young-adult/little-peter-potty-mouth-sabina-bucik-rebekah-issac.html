  <title>Little Peter Potty Mouth - Sabina Bucik, Rebekah Issac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I live in Sydney Australia with my husband and two white cats. I also have Bi-polar and schizo-effective disorder.
Which means that I can&#39;t work full time so writing is an excellent way to make a bit of extra cash as well as have
a creative outlet. I also have studied acting and singing but I have found my true calling to be writing, in which
I hope I can also inspire other people to follow their dreams. I also love of course reading and watching movies.
My good friend Rebecca Issac drew the illustations for the book. In which I think she has done an excellent job.
I hope you enjoy reading little Peter potty mouth and I look forward to reading some feedback.
