  <title>Helen May Saves the Day - Nina Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Helen May the field mouse lives in a shoe at the top of a hill surrounded by all of her creature friends. She loves her home with a view and doesn&#39;t plan to leave. But one day, she hears some startling news. The farmer plans to sell their little piece of paradise, and the new owners plan to turn it into a resort.   Helen May calls a meeting of all her animal friends. They decide she should talk to Farmer George and convince him to keep his land and their home. But will the farmer listen to a little mouse?   Through rhyming words and pictures, Helen May Saves the Day tells the story of a little field mouse, who overcomes her biggest fear of facing a human to fight for what she loves most: her home and friends. It teaches children that even the smallest creature can make a big difference in this world if they set their mind to it." />
