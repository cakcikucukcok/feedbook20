So, if your child is interested in Moon related things and stories, then this volume is for them! Alternatively, if your inner-child has a weakness for Moon-things, then look no further and download the 18 enjoyable stories from different peoples around the world. Some of these stories are well known and easily recognisable, others less so, but all are nonetheless enjoyable to read.&lt;br /&gt;
The 18 stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Man In The Moon&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy Who Had&amp;nbsp; A Moon On His Forehead And A Star On His Chin&lt;br /&gt;
The Stones Of Five Colors And The Empress Jokwa&lt;br /&gt;
The Buried Moon&lt;br /&gt;
The Moon And The Great Snake&lt;br /&gt;
The Mouse And The Moonbeam&lt;br /&gt;
A Capful Of Moonshine&lt;br /&gt;
The Lady Of The Moon&lt;br /&gt;
The Moon-Stroke&lt;br /&gt;
Sun And Moon - American Indian, Yaqui&lt;br /&gt;

The Story Of Argilius&amp;nbsp; And The Flame-King&lt;br /&gt;
While the stories are entertaining the numerous illustrations will fire children&amp;rsquo;s imaginations and take them into fairy land, where, of course, anything is possible. Nowhere has this &amp;ldquo;firing of the imagination&amp;rdquo; been made more apparent than in the entertainments industry with the advent of Green Screen-CGI technology which has enabled the imaginations of &amp;ldquo;big children&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;to run wild and bring all sorts of imaginations to life - especially in the fairy and folk tales genre where we have seen a wholesale revival of interest.&lt;br /&gt;
