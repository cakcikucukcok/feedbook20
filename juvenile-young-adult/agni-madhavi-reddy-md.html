  <title>Agni - Madhavi Reddy Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jasmine is excited to go to the State Fair.   So, is the rest of her family, including Mom, Dad, and her little brother, Om.  They arrive and get ready to have tons of fun.  All around them are games, rides, animals and friends. &lt;p&gt;
Jasmine, her little brother, Om, mother and father are having a great day.  They sit down to have a family picnic.  Om reaches for some chocolate-covered peanuts.  &lt;p&gt;
Jasmine realizes something is wrong.  Om looks sick and starts to have trouble breathing.   Jasmines father calls for an ambulance.  Jasmine is scared for her brother.  She prays.  &lt;p&gt;
Agni arrives.  Agni is the Superhero of Health.   Using her special powers, Agni is able to cure Om from a dangerous food allergy.  &lt;p&gt;
Inspired by an experience with a pediatric patient in her Urgent Care Clinic, Dr. Madhavi Reddy wrote &lt;i&gt;Agni&lt;/i&gt; to educate children and their parents about allergic reactions and how to manage this specific situation.  Dr. Reddy hopes to relieve fears children may have regarding doctors, injections, and ambulances." />
