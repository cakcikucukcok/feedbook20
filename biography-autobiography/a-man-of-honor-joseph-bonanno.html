  <title>A Man of Honor - Joseph Bonanno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Friendships, connections, family ties, trust, loyalty, obedience-this was the &#39;glue&#39; that held us together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were the principles that the greatest Mafia &quot;Boss of Bosses,&quot; Joseph Bonnano, lived by. Born in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, Bonnano found his future amid the whiskey-running, riotous streets of Prohibition America in 1924, when he illegally entered the United States to pursue his dreams. By the age of only twenty-six, Bonnano became a Don. He would eventually take over the New York underworld, igniting the &quot;Castellammarese War,&quot; one of the bloodiest Family battles ever to hit New York City...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in this candid and stunning memoir, Joe Bonanno-likely a model for Don Corleone in the blockbuster movie The Godfather-takes readers inside the world of the real Mafia. He reveals the inner workings of New York&#39;s Five Families-Bonanno, Gambino, Profaci, Lucchese, and Genovese-and uncovers how the Mafia not only dominated local businesses, but also influenced national politics. A fascinating glimpse into the world of crime, &lt;i&gt;A Man of Honor&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable account of one of the most powerful crime figures in America&#39;s history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
