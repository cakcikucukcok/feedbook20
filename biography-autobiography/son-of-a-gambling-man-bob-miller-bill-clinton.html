  <title>Son of a Gambling Man - Bob Miller, Bill Clinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A memoir of growing up in mob-run Sin City from a casino heir-turned-governor who&#39;s seen two sides of every coin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bob Miller arrived in Las Vegas as a boy, it was a small, dusty city, a far cry from the glamorous, exciting place it is today. Driving the family car was his father Ross Miller, a tough guy--though a good family man--who had operated on both sides of the law on some of the meaner streets of industrial Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Miller family was as close and as warm as &quot;Ozzie and Harriet,&quot; as long as you knew that Ozzie was a bookmaker and a business acquaintance of some very dubious criminal types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bob grew up, so did Vegas, now a &quot;town&quot; of some two million. Ross Miller became a respectable businessman and partner in a major casino, though he was still capable of settling a score with his fists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Bob went on to law school, entering law enforcement and eventually becoming a popular governor of Nevada, holding office longer than anybody in the state&#39;s history. And the Miller family&#39;s legacy continues. Bob&#39;s own son is presently serving as Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warm family memoir, the story of a city heir, with just a little bit of &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Casino&lt;/i&gt; thrown in for spice, &lt;i&gt;Son of a Gambling Man &lt;/i&gt;is a unique and thoroughly memorable story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
