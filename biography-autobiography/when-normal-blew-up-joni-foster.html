  <title>When Normal Blew Up - Joni Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1967, in the small town of Circleville, Ohio, a man walked into an old-fashioned drug store on a busy Saturday and laid a smoking package on the pharmacy counter in the back. He shouted for everyone to leave,&amp;nbsp; he had a bomb. The store owner grabbed the package and ran down the back hallway. The man chased the owner, grabbed him and struggled to take the package away. A pharmacist saw what was happening, raced after both, and tried to pull the two apart. A clerk was standing at the back door. A bookkeeper was in the back office, unaware. The bomb went off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five people died that day, leaving five spouses and fifteen children to grieve in silence and a stunned community to pick up the pieces.&amp;nbsp; Fifty years later, Joni Foster, who was nine at the time and daughter of the pharmacist who died, began a quest to find out in detail who these people were and what exactly happened.&amp;nbsp; Over nine months, she would interview members from each family to hear their stories of what life was like before, what happened that day, and how they moved forward.&amp;nbsp; Most of the people she interviewed had never told their story before to anyone, including members of their own families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is a tragedy, a history lesson on the slow, painful emancipation of women, and ultimately a love story to the families trying to live normal lives.&lt;br /&gt;
