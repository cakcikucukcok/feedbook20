  <title>The Magic Carpet Ride - Crystal Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Crystal Dunn was a born sensitive. From her earliest days, she has always seen the world with uncommon depth, a perception that has given her an adventurous and spiritually rewarding life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Magic Carpet Ride&lt;/i&gt;, she shares her life story, from a childhood full of imagination and connected to the supernatural through a youth and adulthood dedicated to helping others. Dunn has explored the emotional depths of human nature and gained great understanding through her work as a caregiver, mentor, and advisor for the elderly, youth, and disabled population of our society. Now she shares the ups and downs of the heart-opening lessons she learned along the way. Throughout her journey, synchronicity, insights, and personal tragedy have awakened a movement within her to carry messages of transformation. This led Dunn on a special spiritual adventure taking her from Australia to Aotearoa, New Zealand, where she came to know and love Maori traditions and culture and became more involved in a magical, natural world steeped in sacredness and legend.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Engaging and inspirational, this memoir shares the personal story and journey of an energy healer with a deep and lifelong connection to the spiritual world.&lt;/P&gt;" />
