  <title>The Book of Eating - Adam Platt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wildly hilarious and irreverent memoir of a globe-trotting life lived meal-to-meal by one of our most influential and respected food critics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the son of a diplomat growing up in places like Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan, Adam Platt didn&amp;#8217;t have the chance to become a picky eater. Living, traveling, and eating in some of the most far-flung locations around the world, he developed an eclectic palate and a nuanced understanding of cultures and cuisines that led to some revelations which would prove important in his future career as a food critic. In Tokyo, for instance&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;a kind of paradise for nose-to-tail cooking&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;he learned that &amp;#8220;if you&amp;#8217;re interested in telling a story, a hair-raisingly bad meal is much better than a good one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From dim sum in Hong Kong to giant platters of Peking duck in Beijing, fresh-baked croissants in Paris and pierogi on the snowy streets of Moscow, Platt takes us around the world, re-tracing the steps of a unique, and lifelong, culinary education. Providing a glimpse into a life that has intertwined food and travel in exciting and unexpected ways, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Eating&lt;/em&gt; is a delightful and sumptuous trip that is also the culinary coming-of-age of a voracious eater and his eventual ascension to become, as he puts it, &amp;#8220;a professional glutton.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />
