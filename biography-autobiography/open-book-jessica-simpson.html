  <title>Open Book - Jessica Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica reveals for the first time her inner monologue and most intimate struggles. Guided by the journals she&#39;s kept since age fifteen, and brimming with her unique humor and down-to-earth humanity,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Open Book&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is as inspiring as it is entertaining.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be a very different book. Five years ago, Jessica Simpson was approached to write a motivational guide to living your best life. She walked away from the offer, and nobody understood why. The truth is that she didn&amp;#8217;t want to lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica couldn&amp;#8217;t be authentic with her readers if she wasn&amp;#8217;t fully honest with herself first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now America&amp;#8217;s Sweetheart, preacher&amp;#8217;s daughter, pop phenomenon, reality tv pioneer, and the billion-dollar fashion mogul invites readers on a remarkable journey, examining a life that blessed her with the compassion to help others, but also burdened her with an almost crippling need to please.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Open Book&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;is Jessica Simpson using her voice, heart, soul, and humor to share things she&amp;#8217;s never shared before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First celebrated for her voice, she became one of the most talked-about women in the world, whether for music and fashion, her relationship struggles, or as a walking blonde joke. But now, instead of being&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;talked&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica is doing the talking. Her book shares the wisdom and inspirations she&amp;#8217;s learned and shows the real woman behind all the pop-culture clich&amp;#233;&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;chicken or fish,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Daisy Duke,&amp;#8221; &quot;football jinx,&quot; &amp;#8220;mom jeans,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;sexual napalm&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; and more.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Open Book&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is an opportunity to laugh and cry with a close friend, one that will inspire you to live your best, most authentic life, now that she is finally living hers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
