  <title>Our Father: The Prodigal Son Returns - Bruce Smith, David Rowlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our Father is a compelling memoir by Bruce Smith chronicling his life as a fatherless boy growing up in segregated Texas and his rise to fame and fortune as a star professional football player and real estate mogul. As his story unfolds, ghosts from his past and the lingering effects of being raised without a stable father figure, haunt him. Throughout the book, Smith takes the reader on an emotional, sometimes funny, at times painful journey, illustrating how the power of personal redemption and salvation transforms his life. A thought provoking read, it draws attention to the problem of fatherlessness, described by social commentators as one of the most serious issues facing society today. Statistics on youth crime, addiction, drop out rates and teen pregnancy, paint a picture of the devastating effects, the lack of engaged fathers in our homes is having on children. Pastor Smith s story gives insight into the feelings of hopelessness and confusion that fatherless children, particularly boys tend to experience and the self-destructive choices they make as a result. While Our Father speaks candidly about the harmful effects of fatherlessness on youth and society, it is a story about hope that illustrates how through the saving power of Jesus Christ, we can all conquer our demons and triumph." />
