  <title>Tinderbox - Megan Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Megan Dunn was in a hole. Her attempt to write a fictional tribute to Fahrenheit 451 wasn&#39;t going well. Borders, the bookseller she worked for, was going bust. Her marriage was failing. Her prospects were narrowing. The world wasn’t quite against her – but it wasn’t exactly helping either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riffing on Ray Bradbury&#39;s classic novel about the end of reading, &lt;i&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most interesting books in decades about literary culture and its place in the world. More than that, it&#39;s about how every one of us fits into that bigger picture – and the struggle to make sense of life in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough for a book about failures in art, &lt;i&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/i&gt; itself is a fantastic achievement; a wonderfully crafted and beautifully written work of non-fiction that is by turns brilliantly funny and achingly sad. … &lt;i&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most successful books about failure you will ever read. &lt;/p&gt;" />
