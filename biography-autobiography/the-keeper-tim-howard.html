  <title>The Keeper - Tim Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I believe that we will win.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, Tim Howard became an overnight sensation after more than ten years as one of America&amp;#39;s leading professional soccer players. His record-breaking 15 saves for the United States national team against Belgium in the World Cup electrified a nation that had only recently woken up to the Beautiful Game after decades of hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated TV audience of 21 million viewers in the U.S.&amp;#8212;larger than those of the NBA and NHL finals&amp;#8212;watched Howard&amp;#39;s heroic performance against the heavily favored Belgians in which he repelled shots with his hands, feet, legs, knees, and even his signature long beard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly an athlete who had toiled in relative anonymity for much of his career became the star of his own Internet meme (&amp;#34;Things Tim Howard Could Save&amp;#34;: from Janet Jackson&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;wardrobe malfunction&amp;#34; to the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;), and fielded personal calls from the likes of President Barack Obama (&amp;#34;You guys did us proud. . . . I don&amp;#39;t know how you are going to survive the mobs when you come back home, man. You&amp;#39;ll have to shave your beard so they don&amp;#39;t know who you are&amp;#34;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this inspiring and candid memoir, the beloved U.S. and Everton goalkeeper finally allows himself to do something that he would never do on the field: he drops his guard. Howard opens up for the first time about how a hyperactive kid from New Jersey with Tourette Syndrome defied the odds to become one of the greatest American keepers in history. He recalls his childhood, being raised by a single mother who instilled in him a love of all sports&amp;#8212;he was also a standout high school basketball player&amp;#8212;and a devout faith that helped him cope with a disorder that manifested itself with speech and facial tics, compulsive behavior, and extreme sensitivity to light, noise, and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Keeper&lt;/em&gt; is also a chronicle of the personal sacrifices he&amp;#39;s made for his career, including the ultimate dissolution of Howard&amp;#39;s marriage&amp;#8212;a casualty of what he calls his &amp;#34;addiction to winning&amp;#34;&amp;#8212;and its most painful consequence: his separation from his two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A treat for soccer fans, &lt;em&gt;The Keeper&lt;/em&gt; will even captivate readers who are unfamiliar with the sport but want to know what makes a world-class athlete different from the rest of us&amp;#8212;and where that difference gives way to common ground.&lt;/p&gt;" />
