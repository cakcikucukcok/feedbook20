  <title>Sonny - Ron Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It has been more than sixty years since anyone called author Ron Gabriel Sonny. The nickname was bestowed upon him back in Delaware, Ohio, and it carried through the 1940s and 50s. Back then, Sonny was a carefree kid who spent his days running around the neighborhood with his buddies, getting into the occasional scuffle and scrape. Six decades later, how things have changed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sonny is the true account of a young man who lived out his days in the Midwest. Back then, there was no such thing as Little League; the kids made their own games instead, running and playing as they chose. As Sonny grew up, so did his interests. He bought his first car for forty dollars and nicknamed it The Green Spleen. He met the love of his life and became a husband and fatherand, eventually, a grandfather.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Intended to entertain, amuse, and inform, Sonny offers a detailed recording of how the world once was, before the existence of cell phones and the Internet. Gabriel played witness to several events in history, but he also created his own history as a grandfather and an Ohio State fan. Take a step back to another time, when things were more innocent, people moved a bit slower, and young Sonny dreamed of an unknown future.&lt;/P&gt;" />
