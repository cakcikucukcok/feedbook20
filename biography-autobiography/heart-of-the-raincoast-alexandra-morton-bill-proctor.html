  <title>Heart of the Raincoast - Alexandra Morton, Bill Proctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Originally published in 1998, this updated edition has a brand-new cover and interior design, with a new foreword by Alexandra Morton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;Billy Proctor was born in 1934 and has spent his entire life in a remote coastal community called Echo Bay, BC on an island off northern Vancouver Island. Proctor has always done the time-honoured work of generations of upcoast men&amp;#8212;hand-logging, fishing, clam digging, repairing boats, beachcombing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;But Billy eventually began to notice that the thriving runs of Pacific salmon, oolichans, and herring that he remembers from his early years were vanishing&amp;#8212;some to near extinction&amp;#8212;and he understood that it was time to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heart of the Raincoast&lt;/i&gt; is the fascinating story of Billy Proctor&amp;#8217;s life, and the wealth of knowledge and understanding that can only be gained from living in such close proximity to nature. The writing is funny, touching and honest&amp;#8212;and offers an engaging insider&amp;#8217;s view not only of the salmon, whales, eagles and independent people who populate Canada&amp;#8217;s wild and lovely coastal rainforest, but on what we need to do to keep it as nature intended.&lt;/p&gt;" />
