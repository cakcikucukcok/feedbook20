  <title>From Richard Kimble to Barack Obama - Hossam Nasser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays troubled world, it is imperative that we develop an accurate and precise understanding of the other people who share the planet with us. How they think, why they act the way they do, and why we think they hate America, or do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From Richard Kimble to Barack Obama is a mixture of personal experiences intertwined with political events that span over five decades. You will read a totally fresh perspective about political events along with a different assessment of those major players who helped shape them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will realize how conventional wisdom may be a synonym to mental complacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who had one foot planted in the land of the Pharaohs and the other deeply rooted into the land of opportunity, I am going to tell you my side of the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share with you the perspective of a man born and raised in the Middle East, but chose America for his home, and will let you in on what goes on in the minds and hearts of people in this vital and turbulent part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is written for every American who cares enough about this great nation to make a serious effort at learning about the other side of the story, and in doing so may discover an uncharted path to world peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
