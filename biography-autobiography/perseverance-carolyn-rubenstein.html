  <title>Perseverance - Carolyn Rubenstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine being in high school or college and suddenly learning you have cancer?  You thought you had a lifetime ahead of you and the whole world at your feet, but suddenly you&#39;re told... maybe not.  How would you cope?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the question the twenty young people in this book had to answer when they were diagnosed with childhood cancer.  &lt;i&gt;Perseverance&lt;/i&gt; tells of their trials and tribulations, of their triumphs, and of the unique challenges that day-to-day college life brings them.  &lt;i&gt;Perseverance&lt;/i&gt; also provides an intimate look at the lives and journeys of these young people and how their courage and strength have affected the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These honest, first-person accounts lend amazing depth to the inspiring stories of these young men and women.  Inside, you&#39;ll meet Zac York, who tells of climbing Mount Whitney--on crutches--after battling brain cancer.  You&#39;ll meet Alex Oden, who--just days after brain surgery--gave his 8th grade peers a graduation speech called &quot;A Day Well Spent,&quot; in which he challenged them to make a difference in just one day.  You&#39;ll meet Kristen Jones, who, while battling leukemia, was able to pass the MCAT and pursue her dream of becoming a pediatric oncologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty unique and fascinating stories, with one common theme: perseverance. The stories of these heroes demonstrate how anyone can learn to live with energy and passion, regardless of the obstacles to be faced, and will remind us all that now is everything.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
