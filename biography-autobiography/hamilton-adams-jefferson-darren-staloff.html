  <title>Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson - Darren Staloff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where The Ideas for which We Stand came from.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this incisively drawn book, Darren Staloff forcefully reminds us that America owes its guiding political traditions to three Founding Fathers whose lives embodied the collision of Europe&#39;s grand Enlightenment project with the birth of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Hamilton, the worldly New Yorker; John Adams, the curmudgeonly Yankee; Thomas Jefferson, the visionary Virginia squire--each governed their public lives by Enlightenment principles, and for each their relationship to the politics of Enlightenment was transformed by the struggle for American independence. Repeated humiliation on America&#39;s battlefields banished Hamilton&#39;s youthful idealism, leaving him a disciple of Enlightened realpolitik and the nation&#39;s leading exponent of modern statecraft. After ten years in Europe&#39;s diplomatic trenches, Adams&#39;s embrace of the politics of Enlightenment became increasingly skeptical in spirit, and his public posture became increasingly that of the gadfly of his country. And Jefferson&#39;s frustrations as a Revolutionary governor in Virginia led him to go beyond his Enlightened worldview, and articulate a new and radical Romantic politics of principle. As a consequence, Americans demand a government that is both modern, constrained by checks and balances, and capable of appealing to our loftiest aspirations while adhering to decidedly pragmatic policies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
