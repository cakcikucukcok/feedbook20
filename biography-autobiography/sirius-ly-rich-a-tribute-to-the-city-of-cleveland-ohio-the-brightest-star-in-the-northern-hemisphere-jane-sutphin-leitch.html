  <title>Sirius-ly Rich: A Tribute to the City of Cleveland, Ohio, the Brightest Star In the Northern Hemisphere - Jane Sutphin Leitch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane Sutphin Leitch has pulled a memoir out of her once stylish hat. It introduces her father, an ordinary guy, who bought a defunct ice hockey team, borrowed a million dollars on his signature in 1934, at 39 years old, to build an ice palace of almost 10,000 seats. He had to pay it all back in the Great Depression of the 1930&#39;s. He just happened to mention this at the dinner table to the startled Irish mother of six children. Throughout a 50 year marital adventure, what follows is the magic of show business, the might of small manufacturing and the magnitude of a devoted family and fascinating loyal friends who find themselves 100 years later, still wondering how it all plays out." />
