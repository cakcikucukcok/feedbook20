  <title>Conversations with Sterling Plumpp - John Zheng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conversations with Sterling Plumpp&lt;/i&gt; is the first collection of interviews with the renowned poet of &lt;i&gt;Home/Bass&lt;/i&gt; and other much-admired works. Spanning thirty years and drawn from literary and scholarly journals and other media, these interviews offer insights into his poetic innovation of blues and jazz and his mastery of black vernacular in poetry. This collection seems fundamental to an understanding of the life and work of an African American poet who has been innovative in fusing blues and jazz rhythms with poetic insight and in vivifying the vernacular landscape of African American poetry.&lt;p&gt;Born in 1940 in Clinton, Mississippi, Plumpp has been living in Chicago since 1962. &lt;i&gt;Home/Bass&lt;/i&gt; received the 2014 American Book Award. The finest blues poet of his generation, Plumpp became a model for contemporary poetry and poetics and a leading figure in the tradition of blues/jazz poetry. He continues to reinvent the language while exploring the registers of individual and communal memory, local, national, and global history. His poetry is important in attempts to define the black aesthetic from the era of the Harlem Renaissance to the seminal Black Arts Movement. It is also important for its re-articulation of the Great Migration, especially expressed by blues musicians who left Mississippi for Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;" />
