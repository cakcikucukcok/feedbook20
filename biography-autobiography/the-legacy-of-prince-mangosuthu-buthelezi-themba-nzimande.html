  <title>The Legacy of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi - Themba Nzimande</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many myths and fallacies have surrounded the life of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi; a man who has
played a profound and undeniable role in shaping the history and culture of South Africa for more
than half a century. Yet even his opponents refer to him as the doyen of South African politics.
This book chronicles Buthelezis legacy in South Africas struggle for liberation. It examines his
utterances, beliefs and warnings, to the ANC alliance, the apartheid government and the people of
South Africa at large.
In doing so, it exposes the myths and challenges the propaganda, while forging a clearer picture
of the man about whom so much has been written.
The book considers Buthelezis principled advocacy of peaceful change, when it was fashionable to
cry for violence. It explores his influential role at the negotiating table at CODESA and reflects on why
his vision and commitment could not be ignored by his opponents. His active espousal of federalism,
in direct opposition to the unitary one-party state envisioned by the ANC, is also investigated.
Finally the book chronicles Buthelezis service in the Government of National Unity and the reasons
why Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki entrusted him with running the State more than
twenty times over a five year period.
Through writing this book, the author has come face to face with the unique character of Buthelezi,
from his remarkable leadership skills to his workaholic tendencies. Buthelezis undeniable integrity,
loyalty, faith and wisdom have influenced the making of his legacy, which has somehow married liberal
values with ubuntu botho - a form of African humanism.
For more than 60 years Buthelezi has carried the torch he inherited from leaders like Dr Pixley ka
Isaka Seme, Professor ZK Mathews and Inkosi Albert Luthuli. This book describes the journey.
Themba Nzimande holds a degree in political science and public management. He has been
involved in the politics of the Inkatha Freedom Party since its inception in 1975 and has served on its
Central Committee." />
