A Memoir and Survival Guide&amp;quot; and find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journalist and broadcaster Marsha Boulton made the leap that so many urbanites only fantasize about. As more and more people today are choosing country life over city life, Marsha&amp;#39;s experiences propel the reader into her world with hilarious consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who knew that a hair dryer could become an indispensable farm tool?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What lessons are learned when a lawyer buys a farm as a weekend retreat and then buys 10 bulls to breed his 10 cows? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether in the lambing shed serving as midwife, picking two acres of pickle cucumbers or analyzing the intelligence of turkeys, Marsha&amp;#39;s observations on her rural learning curve offer a roller coaster ride filled with bucolic wonder and genuine affection for creatures large and small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A runaway bestseller when first published in Canada, &amp;quot;Letters From the Country&amp;quot; received the Stephen Leacock Award for Humor, prompting one of her neighbors to say: &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let that go to your head, girl. After all they nominated a pig named Babe for an Academy Award.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, for the first time in the United States and around the world, readers can revel in what one reviewer cited as &amp;quot;humor on the lamb.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Editorial Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re thinking about a move to rural digs, &amp;#39;Letters From the Country&amp;#39; is must reading.&amp;quot; (The Calgary Herald)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;An affectionate, humorous and personal account of a city woman&amp;#39;s leap into life &amp;#39;down on the farm&amp;#39; - Boulton&amp;#39;s voice of experience makes her book a unique achievement.&amp;quot; (David Staines, University of Ottawa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If nothing else, you&amp;#39;ll know why sheep sometimes have crayon marks on their backsides - a sweet collection, sprinkled with insights about the realities of moving to the country.&amp;quot; (The Hamilton Spectator)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;One of those rare books that will appeal to almost every reader.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;(The London Free Press)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Boulton&amp;#39;s musings are as soft as a lamb&amp;#39;s fleece. The 57 pieces in the collection, classified by the four seasons, capture some key elements of rural living ... Another good choice for the humor prize.&amp;quot; (The Globe and Mail)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is a great book - one you cannot put down. Each chapter is a story of funny and serious antics as a woman who made a major career change. Sure to please anyone who lives in either the city or country.&amp;quot; - Babs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a very pleasant book to pick up and enjoy, a chapter at a time. I am not a wannabe farmer and Marsha Boulton does not paint a perfect picture of farm life. However she does manage to convey the joys and aggravation of life in the country. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to live there but I would certainly like to visit. (As long as I don&amp;#39;t need to deal with the sheep!) - Teacher Suzanne&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is one of my comfort books. When I&amp;#39;m feeling down or out of sorts, I take refuge in a hot bath with this book. The book is a collection of stories written by a woman who moves from the big city (the &amp;#39;big smoke&amp;#39; as her country neighbors call it) to a farm. The stories are arranged by season and there are a good variety of topics. The writing is light but very competently written nonetheless. - John&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journalist and broadcaster Marsha Boulton - big city woman - moves to the country and becomes a shepherd. She never dreamed she would do this and how it came about is enjoyable and funny. - Helen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Love the short tales which allow me to read a few chapters before bedtime. I live in a rural area and can identify with the stories in this book.&amp;quot; - Patricia" />
