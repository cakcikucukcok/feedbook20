  <title>A Retirement Blog: February 2012 - August 2014 - David Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Retired theatre professor and attorney David Stevens began blogging in February 2012. This book is a collection of his blogs through August 2014. He has, he says, the academic habit of writing about whatever he is thinking about, so his blog deals with legal issues, theatrical issues, political issues, and personal reminiscences. Eight essays constituted his legal memoir, For Three Weeks I Owned the University of Illinois. Five more served as early drafts of chapters of his textbook, The Art and Craft of Play Directing. Some six essays make up his as yet unpublished theatrical memoir. Also included are portions of chapters from his other academic books, as well as a chapter from his yet-unfinished novel. Finally, Stevens rants effectively about the unconstitutional attempts of the Illinois legislature to reduce or eliminate the automatic annual increases in state retiree pensions, as well as other political issues such as the electoral college and the 2012 presidential election." />
