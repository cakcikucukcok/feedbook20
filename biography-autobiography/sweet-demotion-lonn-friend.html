  <title>Sweet Demotion - Lonn Friend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his first book, Life on Planet Rock, author Lonn Friend shared his ringside view of rocks decade of decadence. Now, in Sweet Demotion, the veteran rock scribe takes off the gloves and battles himself.  
Lonn was enjoying a six-figure multi-media career in 1998 when, at the end of a four-year run as a record company VP, he was bitch slapped by the Universe; his professional ride came to a crashing pause. But instead of hiring headhunters or putting a resume together to find another gig, Lonn hit the rock-and-roll road less traveled. The result is a brutally transparent, shamelessly self-deprecating mid-life memoir of a writer who stopped making money and started seeking truth.  
Sweet Demotion chronicles a thirteen-year period of personal deconstruction, spiritual madness, and bizarre anecdotal wordplay where faith was lost in everything but the moment and the music. Lonns intimate adventure invites the reader to a porn burial in the desert, a Janis Joplin ghost sighting, a Dallas meditation on the anniversary of JFKs assassination following the interview of a heavy metal legend, and the sharing of sacred space on a northeast lake with the lead singer of Aerosmith. Sweet Demotion is a sojourn to near-enlightenment that no one but Lonn Friend could have possibly experienced." />
