  <title>A Test Drive to Chicago - David J. Suvak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Back when I was seventeen, a buddy and I took a car for a test drive. I guess we really wanted to test it because we drove it all the way from the suburbs of Cleveland to Chicago. That was one of the first of many trips in my life. Since then, they have been tamer and less intense but, certainly, still exciting. 
Ive come across quite a few memorable people and places, and this story touches some of those experiences. We all have our little story to tell about our lives, and this is mine. It is here that I share them with you, and I hope you find some enjoyment out of it.
I look forward to someday reading about your story." />
