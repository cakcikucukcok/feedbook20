June 24, 2014
Mr. Satisfactory is an autobiography and abridged history of the author and his extended family. It tells the authors story of a life growing up in a large loving family from Indianapolis. The story begins with our familys start in the early twentieth century, our parents high school days in the forties, growing up in a Catholic family with seven siblings in the fifties and sixties, and through current day as my generation embarks on our golden years. You will journey with the author, his family, and his friends through his twelve years of parochial education and all the shenanigans and mischief a boy and teen can get himself into. Come along with us on family trips and outings. You will enjoy a front-row seat at athletic events and achievements, holidays, weddings, funerals, and much more. Mr. Satisfactory pays tribute to the authors family and friends. It is a book of real-life unforgettable stories and experiences. Marty exposes his inner thoughts, tells lifelong secrets, and confesses his faults and shortcomings. A strong work ethic, an abundance of common sense, a little bit of luck, and Gods help, turned twelve Satisfactory school years into an Excellent life. I hope you enjoy this book and begin to consider your own lifes story." />
