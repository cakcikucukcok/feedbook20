  <title>Collusion - Evan Zimroth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the vantage point of &quot;real life&quot; (as dancers say), &lt;em&gt;Collusion&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a young girl&#39;s initiation into the disciplined, exalting world of classical ballet and into a secret love relationship with F., the ballet master whom she adored. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you want to be a great dancer?&quot; F. had asked her when she was twelve. She did. And so &lt;em&gt;Collusion&lt;/em&gt; tells of how she gave up ordinary life--family, boyfriends, hamburgers, homework, and pop music--for a life dedicated to the promise of artistry. At the center of that new life was always the figure of F.--ironic, moody, demanding, quixotically generous or withholding--who could control her with a sarcastic comment or the flash of his cane across her thigh, but also with the lyrical beauty of his classes and the vision of herself in a perfect arabesque. F. was the first man to partner her, and the first to teach her that love can come in strange forms: in the airborne lifts of &lt;em&gt;Les Sylphides,&lt;/em&gt; in brilliant pirouettes, and in measured violence. &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collusion&lt;/em&gt; describes the secret life of ballet. It is a life in which &quot;normal&quot; values are reversed. Brutality is seen as a gift, fear as devotion, sadism (rightly, in this case) as love. Free of conventional moral judgments, &lt;em&gt;Collusion&lt;/em&gt; tells of possession and surrender, of power and submission, of the bond between a young girl and an older man. &lt;p&gt;In spare, emotionally resonant prose, award-winning poet and novelist Evan Zimroth unfolds a mesmerizing story of artistic ambition, power, and love in an unforgettable memoir of adolescence. &lt;em&gt;Collusion&lt;/em&gt; portrays a real relationship, one that society dares not speak of, and it does so with admirable honesty and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
