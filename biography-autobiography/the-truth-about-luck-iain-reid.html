  <title>The Truth About Luck - Iain Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selected for The Globe 100 Books in 2013.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Truth about Luck, Iain Reid, author of the highly popular coming-of-age memoir &lt;em&gt;One Bird&#39;s Choice&lt;/em&gt;, accompanies his grandmother on a five-day vacation &amp;#8212; which turns out to be a &quot;staycation&quot; at his apartment in Kingston. While the twenty-eight-year-old writer is at the beginning of his adult life, his ninety-two-year-old grandmother is nearing the end of hers. Between escorting his grandma to local attractions and restaurants, the two exchange memories and she begins to reveal details of her inspiring life story.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Told with subtlety, humour, and heart, this delightful comic memoir reflects on family connections; how we experience adversity, the passage of time, and aging; and most importantly what it truly means to feel lucky.&lt;/p&gt;" />
