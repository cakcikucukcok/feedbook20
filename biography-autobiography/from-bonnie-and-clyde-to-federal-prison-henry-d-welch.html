  <title>From Bonnie and Clyde to Federal Prison - Henry D. Welch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many articles have been written about Bonnie and Clyde however much of it is Hollywood and not correct. I have stayed with facts and tried to tell exactly what happened to this famous pain of Criminals during the Great Depression. The so called Crime Spree was started when Clyde got out of prison in 1932 and killed in 1934. Clyde was raped repeatly while serving time in Eastham Farm a part of the Texas State prison in Huntsville, Texas. They killed 9 Policemen and would also kill 5 civilians if they were threatened. They also loved to kidnap people 7 that we know of that included a police chief and a deputy sheriff rode them aroud releasing them unharmed. Bonnie wrote poems and took pictures that made the newspapers and intriged the public putting them in the spotlight to where everyone admired them and almost worshiped what they were doing. This book has murder, kidnapping, romance, sex, robberey, danger death, and excitement that goes way beyond any movie because it is all true. It tells about how people had to live during the Great Depression.
	Also Welch spent eleven years working in FCI, Federal Correction Institute in Talladega Alabama as Crafts Supervisor tells about life there and about how inmates lived day to day. Most of all he wanted to correct some of falsehoods portside in some of the films about Bonnie and Clyde and prison itself. These two will never be forgotton and information is still surfacing to this day and many more movies will be made about them. On Clyde Barrows tomestone are the words, Gone but Not Forgotten." />
