  <title>Another Kind of Madness - Stephen Hinshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER:&lt;/b&gt; Best Autobiography/Memoir, 2018 Best Book Awards, sponsored by American Book Fest  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glenn Close says: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Another Kind of Madness&lt;/i&gt; is one of the best books I&#39;ve read about the cost of stigma and silence in a family touched by mental illness. I was profoundly moved by Stephen Hinshaw&#39;s story, written beautifully, from the inside-out. It&#39;s a masterpiece.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A deeply personal memoir calling for an end to the dark shaming of mental illness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families are riddled with untold secrets. But Stephen Hinshaw never imagined that a profound secret was kept under lock and key for 18 years within his family--that his father&#39;s mysterious absences, for months at a time, resulted from serious mental illness and involuntary hospitalizations. From the moment his father revealed the truth,  during Hinshaw&#39;s first spring break from college, he knew his life would change forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hinshaw calls this revelation his &quot;psychological birth.&quot; After years of experiencing the ups and downs of his father&#39;s illness without knowing it existed, Hinshaw began to piece together the silent, often terrifying history of his father&#39;s life--in great contrast to his father&#39;s presence and love during periods of wellness. This exploration led to larger discoveries about the family saga, to Hinshaw&#39;s correctly diagnosing his father with bipolar disorder, and to his full-fledged career as a clinical and developmental psychologist and professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Another Kind of Madness&lt;/i&gt;, Hinshaw explores the burden of living in a family &quot;loaded&quot; with mental illness and debunks the stigma behind it.  He explains that in today&#39;s society, mental health problems still receive utter castigation--too often resulting in the loss of fundamental rights, including the inability to vote or run for office or automatic relinquishment of child custody. Through a poignant and moving family narrative, interlaced with shocking facts about how America and the world still view mental health conditions well into in the 21st century, &lt;i&gt;Another Kind of Madness&lt;/i&gt; is a passionate call to arms regarding the importance of destigmatizing mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
