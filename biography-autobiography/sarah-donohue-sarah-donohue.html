  <title>Sarah Donohue - Sarah Donohue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the action packed story of a female racing driver and stuntwoman who lives life on the edge and enjoys every extreme moment of it&amp;hellip; A thrill-seeker by day and glamorous showgirl by night, Sarah Donohue believes in living out her dreams&amp;nbsp;and living life to the full bringing colour and laughter to the lives of everyone around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after a high-speed powerboat crash putting her on a life-support machine, Sarah&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;rsquo;t let dying for four minutes or a face held together by&amp;nbsp;titanium plates dampen her spirits. The crash was documented as one of the worst crashes seen in powerboat racings history yet Sarah returned back to racing with BBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;999&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Ripley&amp;rsquo;s Believe It or Not&amp;rsquo; hiring her as the stunt woman to re-enact her own near fatal experience. Soon after she became the European powerboat champion. Her journey of triumph over adversity is both inspiring and extreme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story of life&amp;nbsp;will take the reader through a roller coaster of emotions as Sarah experiences the highest of highs on podium tops to the lowest of lows as she suffers jealous cyber abusers. The funny stories recalled as a forces pinup and staunch supporter of the military through to the not so funny story of Sarah enduring Donald Trump and his legal team for almost four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feisty girl from Yorkshire loves life and puts as much into it as she can whilst taking anything it throws back at her remaining positive and up beat. This&amp;nbsp;shows that even the impossible can be made possible with the right attitude no matter who you are or where you come from. A motivational, funny and inspirational book showing one woman&amp;rsquo;s journey on taking on any challenge head to head and her world-renowned success in the male dominated sport of offshore powerboat racing. Even death becomes her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
