  <title>Chasing a Dream - Alice Jo Marlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alice lived through the ravages of WWII on the island of Malta in Europe. She saw her father wounded, her cousin die and their house demolished. Her dream began when as a young teenager at the end of the war, she listened to the American Forces Network broadcasting from Stuttgart, Germany and she envisioned marrying her childhood sweetheart, immigrating to America and living happily ever after. She soon married him, had three children and eventually arrived in California to fulfill her fantasy.
&lt;p&gt;Reality does not always live up to our expectations. Her husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Surgery removed the tumor but the psychological scars remained and festered. He suffered a personality change, turning from a loving husband and father into a scared and vengeful man. In his psychosis he blamed the doctors for his condition and even accused her of conspiring with them. 
&lt;p&gt;When his anger and despair escalated to guns and knives, the struggle to survive became her priority. Driven to the brink of suicide she finally sought outside help. This is a story of love lost but also of survival, of changing course, determination, renewal and never losing sight of the dream.
&lt;p&gt;----- A stirring memorable journey, June 20, 2010
This book takes you along with the author through a life journey fraught with twists and turns, heart wrenching drama and survival. A young girl&#39;s heartwrenching account of experiences on the island of Malta before, during and after WW11 gives the reader a sense of having been there. The author&#39;s unexpected detours and setbacks as she pursued her dream makes her triumph over them inspirational.

&lt;p&gt;----- Memoirs so strong, deep, brave and heartfelt!, June 19, 2010
What a read! From Malta and a childhood so different from the U.S (enduring WW two and loss)to adult in the U.S., this book cannot be put down. What a brave, strong and loving woman. Alice never lost sight of her dream, or love of her family. Heartwarming, enlightening, AWESOME! All ages will enjoy reading this book. Cant stop thinking about it. Makes quite an impression on what you can do with a dream, strength and love. What a journey!

&lt;p&gt;----- A heart-tugging memoir with a powerful message, May 30, 2010
This soul-searing memoir by Alice Marlin delivers joy, pathos and inspiration. She shares her experiences of a Victorian childhood in Malta, then facing death and destruction during WWII. Her dreams of marriage, a bright future and emigration to America come true but are devastated by unforseeable events. Be prepared to choke back some tears. I will be amazed if a screenwriter doesn&#39;t soon contact Alice and turn this story into a touching film.
