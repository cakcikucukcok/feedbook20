  <title>Rescued from ISIS - Dimitri Bontinck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rescued from ISIS&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring and terrifying tale of one man&#39;s journey to the Middle East to save his child from radical Islam, and its surprising worldwide repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimitri Bontinck lived every parent&#39;s worst nightmare. His teenage son, introduced to Islam by his girlfriend, fell into the clutches of a radical mosque. Dimitri watched helplessly as his son, Jay, transformed from a gentle boy to a soldier in training, wearing traditional robes and following a strict diet. Completely brainwashed, Jay snuck out of the house and traveled to Syria, all but vanishing. Too late, Dimitri learned that their country, Belgium, was the leading hotbed of Islamic radicalization. Large numbers of teenagers were being lured into this world and expertly indoctrinated into radical Islam. One by one, they disappeared into the Middle East, most never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no one to help him, Dimitri--a white, Christian-raised atheist--set off on his own to save his son. Using only his military training, a lot of courage, and a little luck, he gradually embedded himself deeper and deeper into the Middle East. After months of searching and several close calls--including being thrown in a jail cell and beaten--he was able to find his son and bring him home. The world was shocked at his unprecedented success, and he started receiving pleas from families around the world, asking that he rescue their children, as well. Increasingly fearful for his own life but unable to ignore these cries for help, Dimitri accepted his newfound role as The Jihadi Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
