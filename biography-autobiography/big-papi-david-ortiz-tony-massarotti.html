  <title>Big Papi - David Ortiz, Tony Massarotti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Raised in the Dominican Republic, signed by the Seattle Mariners, and released by the Minnesota Twins, David Ortiz landed in baseball-crazy Boston, of all places. Generally regarded as an underachiever to that point in his career, Ortiz blossomed into one of the most feared and adored sluggers in baseball while altering the course of the game&#39;s history, helping Boston win its first World Series in eighty-six years and thereby breaking the infamous &quot;Curse of the Bambino.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, Ortiz established his place as a truly Ruthian figure in the annals of our national pastime: an imposing figure in the batter&#39;s box, yet an endearing man to the young, particularly in his native Dominican Republic, where he has focused his charitable efforts on improving the health of children. The son of two caring parents, and a loving father of three, Ortiz is a hero to many.&lt;br&gt;Now, in his memoir, the man affectionately known as &quot;Big Papi&quot; recounts his life from growing up in an impoverished area of the Dominican Republic (where baseball is king) to his ascension in Boston (where he became one). Ortiz discusses, in detail, his historic and record-setting performances as a member of the Red Sox, his exploding popularity, the challenges of playing in Boston, and life in the Red Sox clubhouse.&lt;br&gt;BIG PAPI is a unique memoir by a charismatic man who appeals to young and old, on the baseball field or off.&lt;/p&gt;" />
