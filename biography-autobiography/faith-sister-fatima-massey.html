  <title>Faith Sister - Fatima Massey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is inspiring, motivating, tear jerking, life changing, eye opening, and encouraging for your life. Its a daily journal of real-life situations, obstacles, and experiences Ive had as I started my journey of life to walk in obedience by faith. Its my keep-it-real version of life. I also share scenarios that may relate to things happening or has happened in your life or someone you may know. Then, I share ways of handling the situation. I want this to be of help to many as a guideline and instruction book of what it&#39;s like to hear from God. Teaching the world to have faith and walk in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true actions speak louder than words. So, as we walk by faith we are putting our actions into effect. Whether you know it or not, you have the authority to change your life circumstances but an act of faith is essential to allow God to move freely in your life in order to make the changes you desire. Its up to you to decide what type of life you want to live and how to handle those situations. Allow my experiences to open, expand and transform your mindset.&lt;/p&gt;" />
