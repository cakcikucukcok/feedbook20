  <title>Keeping in Paradise - John Fallon, David Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Fallon is an outstanding example... We can be proud of him.&#39; JOCK STEIN John Fallon has always loved Celtic Football Club and pulling on the jersey was a dream come true. Now, for the first time, this legendary goalkeeper tells the fascinating inside story of his years in Paradise. Fallon joined Celtic in the late 1950s and saw the club move from desperate times to glory years, sharing in good times and bad. He was there when Celtic won the Scottish Cup in 1965 and famously he was the substitute goalkeeper for the Lisbon Lions during their European Cup triumph in 1967. When Ronnie Simpson was felled by a missile in South America the same year, Fallon was called into action and performed brilliantly. Then, after crucial mistakes in the game against Rangers in 1968, his career suffered. But John Fallon fought back, playing his part in Celtic s incredible month of April 1969 when they won all three Scottish domestic trophies. It is a career he s rightly proud of and now -Keeping in Paradise- reveals the inside story, as well as some brand new insights into his turbulent relationship with Jock Stein. He also shares his opinions on the art of goalkeeping, the intense psychological warfare of the Old Firm rivalry and the future of the game in Scotland." />
