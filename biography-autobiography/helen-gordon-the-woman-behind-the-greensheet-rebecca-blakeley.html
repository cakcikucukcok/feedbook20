  <title>Helen Gordon: the Woman Behind the Greensheet - Rebecca Blakeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Helen Gordon moved to Houston with her new husband, Robert DeYoung. A no-nonsense, pragmatic mother of three with the heart of a musician and the soul of a painter, Helen was determined to be her own boss by owning and operating her own company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didnt take her long to find success. Helen started the Greensheet, a free advertising tabloid with classified ads and a list of business services, in 1970. Within eight years, she expanded it to five Texas cities without the help of bank loans. But she lived in a good ol boy atmosphere, in which long lunches over dry martinis were the norm and women were generally absent from the boardroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Helen was undeterred. She was determined to build a company that would prosper, and prosper it did. By 2012, the Greensheet had grown to a circulation of 650,000 and appeared within four Texas cities. Today, her company is a household name and continues to be one of the most successful classified tabloids in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her irrepressible optimism, sense of humor, and vivacious personality served her well in her personal and professional life. As told by her daughter, Rebecca, Helen Gordon: The Woman Behind the Greensheet is Helens inspiring true story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
