  <title>Fruits of the Soul 1: A Collection of 30 Stories Which Proves That God&#39;s Words Are Not Wasted But Richly Rewarded - Delroy Constantine-Simms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Fruit of the Soul is a collection of more than 30 inspirational stories based on the biblical term &amp;quot;Fruit of the Spirit&amp;quot; edited by D. Constantine-Simms, In summary this book sums up the nine visible attributes of a true Christian life, which are love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance. Moreover, Fruit of the Soul offers readers a gentle but tenacious opportunity to appreciate God&amp;#39;s loving presence and to co-discern God&amp;#39;s action in every aspect of life. Fruit of the Soul provides a safe and yet stretching context where each story is honoured as the raw material in which readers can learn to discern and receive God&amp;#39;s message without feeling they are under pressure to understand each story based on the interpretation of a preacher, pastor or minister. However, through spiritual self-direction, that will enable readers to discover, how to integrate and express God&amp;#39;s present love in our everyday choices.Enjoy this book, and of course try and live by the fruit of the spirit and avoid the rotten fruit of Satan&amp;#39;s temptation as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
