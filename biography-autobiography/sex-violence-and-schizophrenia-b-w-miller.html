  <title>Sex, Violence, and Schizophrenia - B.W. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is entirely based off of my memories of my psychotic episodes from 1995 through 1997. It is not a book about how a schizophrenic lives; it is more so about what it is like to be schizophrenic. The reader gets right in my head to see and feel what a psychosis is actually like. No punches are pulled. No sugar coated stories here. Its not like what they show in the movies; its much stranger. I dont talk so much about my odd behavior as much as I show the reader what I am going through at the time. Most of the time I could not tell you what or if anything was odd about my behavior, but I go right into what was wrong with my thinking. The book is intense for the reader and very personal for me to share. Some parts of this book may make you laugh and cry at the same time, but the riveting climax might frighten you. There is a recovery, though. Schizophrenia is a disease that can be recovered from, as is testament in that I wrote this book in about four months, while holding a full-time, professional job. Nothing in the book is fictionalized except the names and places and that is out of respect for other peoples privacy. It is a good read for anyone who wants to understand what is going on in the head of a person suffering from psychosis." />
