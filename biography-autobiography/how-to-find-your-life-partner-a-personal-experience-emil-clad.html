  <title>How to Find Your Life Partner! a Personal Experience - Emil Clad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not long after I was saved I met a group of already established Christians who discussed how some preachers made wrong choices in marriage and how it later destroyed their ministries. What scared me most was a particular incident where it was alleged that a spouse confessed to being possessed by
evil spirits and how she succeeded in wrecking the husbands church. That
prompted me to go in search of the way to find the right partner and avoid danger. Being the son of a preacher and a second-generation Christian for 20 years, and having been married for nearly a decade, I have come to tell the adventure of my story how I found my life partner and the Biblical lessons that I learnt in the course of time.&lt;p&gt;
In this book, you will discover&lt;p&gt;
 How the Holy Spirit helps us pray according to the will of God&lt;br&gt;
 The importance of Gods blueprint for you in three main areas, i.e. ministry, marriage, money&lt;br&gt;
 Knowledge of the scriptures as your basis for inheriting the promises of God&lt;br&gt;
 How God works behind-the-scenes to fulfill His promises when we pray&lt;br&gt;
 How to cooperate with God for success in finding your marriage partner" />
