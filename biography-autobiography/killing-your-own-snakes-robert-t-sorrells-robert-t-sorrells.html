  <title>Killing Your Own Snakes - Robert T. Sorrells, Robert T. Sorrells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is not a biography of John Harvey Sorrells.  
	I expect there&#39;ll never be one of those, and that&#39;s probably just as well.  Sometimes I think a writer&#39;s work is his own best autobiography, certainly, and as much biography as he needs.
	But I&#39;m doing this because of two things: one simple, the other far from it.  My late oldest brother, John, sent me a couple of boxes back in 1993 chock-a-block with manuscript and newspaper printed &quot;stuff&quot; written by our father.  I looked through it quickly and was intrigued right away, but didn&#39;t have the time to do anything with it.
	Over a period of about a year I managed to root around considerably more--along with my son, daughter, and wife--and eventually I knew I&#39;d have to mess with it in a much more formal and intentional way.  But that was the simple part: reading all the material; lifting this bit from here and combining it with that shard from there to create a whole that didn&#39;t injure the narra-tive; deciding to stick with the newspaperman&#39;s spellings of words like thru, and cigaret, along with standard newspaper punctuation; deciding how to include not just the &quot;best&quot; stuff, but the typical as well.  All that simply comes with the turf of editing someone else&#39;s material.
	The much harder part, though, was the realization that I was in some ways on a fool&#39;s errand.
	My father died about five weeks before his fifty-second birthday.  At the time, we were living in New York City.  That is, my parents were.  I was the youngest of four children; fifteen; and, with my older brother, Bill, a high school student in Virginia.
	In spite of its rampant self-absorption, crudities, cynicisms, vulgarities, and erupting juices of sexuality, fifteen is a tender age.  Maybe vulnerable is more accurate.  In any event, it&#39;s an age when a boy--even a boy/man--really needs his father. It&#39;s a fragile time, because the boy coming into manhood is coming into a period when he&#39;s just about ready to start knowing his father as another man, as a person, as a human being, as a wonderfully imperfect critter he can love in a way that transcends the boy/Dad relationship.
	It&#39;s always going to be father/son, but when the two are adults, that relationship changes, deepens, transforms.  At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen and heard from those who got to go through it, and as I&#39;ve experienced it from the father side with my own son.
	But I was suddenly and unexpectedly cut off from that chance.  One night my father was alive, sitting at a card table in the living room reading, as I recall my mother telling it--likely a mystery novel--in the apartment in New York, when he got bushwhacked by a massive heart attack.  
	My mother, who was in their bedroom in the rear of the apartment, said she heard some-thing fall.  Hurrying out to see what had happened, she found him on the floor.  She knelt by him and said he kept looking up at her asking, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?  What&#39;s wrong?&quot; as though something had happened to her.  Within five minutes he was dead.
	What these days might be called a lack of &quot;closure&quot; absolutely overwhelmed me, and one way or another I have been looking for my father ever since.  One way or another his wrenching disappearance has informed virtually everything I myself have ever written.
	So when I saw the mass of stuff in those boxes my brother sent me, I was againcon-sciously for the first time in years--on the gossamer trail of my father, hoping to find out some-thing, trying to learn something, circling like a dog before she flops, anxious to discover some-hing that would do . . . what?
	Easy:  It would let me know my father just as though he hadn&#39;t died when I was a boy; just as though he hadn&#39;t been a-moldering in a Graceland Cemetery grave in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, for more than forty-five years.
