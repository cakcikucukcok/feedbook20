  <title>My Roots and Blossoms - Diantha Ain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the early twentieth century in the United States, times and activities were radically different from the present day. The pace of everyday life was considerably slower, and children were allowed much more freedom, especially in country towns like Colonia, New Jersey, where this story begins. As a new development of custom homes emerges
in this pastoral setting, new friendships and
families grow with it, allowing their lives to mix and blend with each other. This was the world that Diantha Ain lived in as a child.&lt;p&gt;
In this collection of stories and verse, share in the joys, troubles, and sorrows that life brought to her and her family. The stressful news of the world interrupted daily life only in brief segments on the radio. Ain recalls a simple, four-room schoolhouse
with six grades that offered exceptional opportunities for young minds and spirits.
In &lt;i&gt;My Roots and Blossoms&lt;/i&gt;, you will follow
a precocious little girl through the Great
Depression during the 1930s, as she finds the inspiration, creativity, courage, faith, and ambition that eventually shape her entire life.&lt;p&gt;
This charming collection of remembrances, poetry, and memories of years past will charm young and old alike." />
