  <title>The Other Side of the Trench - G. S. Willmott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story deserves to be told. Garry Willmott creates graphic and quite horrifying insights into unseen and &#39;unsung&#39; aspects of World War 1, where so many Australian, Canadian, British, New Zealander, American and French soldiers were slaughtered and still, today, lie uninterred in forgotten furrows of French fields. The author tells this story in a simple direct style which has an immediate impact. Garry Willmott&#39;s ancestors are among those who lost their lives fighting against the Kaiser&#39;s Juggernaut. The characters of the soldiers come to life and even in death, their spirits are revived in the telling. The courage of our soldiers and their betrayal by British Generals moves the reader to sorrow and to anger as we witness not only the terrible personal suffering of the soldiers, but also the long-term effects upon families left behind. *** Win a Trip to France and Belgium *** Full details of the trip and how to enter are available via a link inside the eBook - the first 10,000 to purchase a copy of this eBook are eligible to register for the competition." />
