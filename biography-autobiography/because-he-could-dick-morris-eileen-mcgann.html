  <title>Because He Could - Dick Morris, Eileen McGann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who is Bill Clinton?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man whose presidency was disgraced by impeachment -- yet who remains one of the most popular presidents of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man whose autobiography, &lt;em&gt;My Life&lt;/em&gt;, was panned by critics as a self-indulgent daily diary -- but rode the bestseller lists for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man whose policies changed America at the close of the twentieth century -- yet whose weakness left us vulnerable to terror at the dawn of the twenty-first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one better understands the inner Bill Clinton, that creature of endless and vexing contradiction, than Dick Morris. From the Arkansas governor&#39;s races through the planning of the triumphant 1996 reelection, Morris was Clinton&#39;s most valued political adviser. Now, in the wake of Clinton&#39;s million-selling memoir &lt;em&gt;My Life&lt;/em&gt;, Morris and his wife, Eileen McGann, set the record straight with &lt;em&gt;Because He Could&lt;/em&gt;, a frank and perceptive deconstruction of the story Clinton tells -- and the many more revealing stories he leaves untold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the same keen insight they brought to Hillary Clinton&#39;s life in their recent bestseller &lt;em&gt;Rewriting History&lt;/em&gt;, Morris and McGann uncover the hidden sides of the complicated and sometimes dysfunctional former president. Whereas Hillary is anxious to mask who she really is, they show, Bill Clinton inadvertently reveals himself at every turn -- as both brilliant and undisciplined, charming yet often filled with rage, willing to take wild risks in his personal life but deeply reluctant to use the military to protect our national security. The Bill Clinton who emerges is familiar -- reflexively blaming every problem on right-wing persecutors or na&amp;#239;ve advisers -- but also surprising: passive, reactive, working desperately to solve a laundry list of social problems yet never truly grasping the real thrust of his own presidency. And while he courted danger in his personal life, the authors argue that Clinton&#39;s downfall has far less to do with his private demons than with his fear of the one person who controlled his future: his own first lady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp and stylishly written, full of revealing insider anecdotes, &lt;em&gt;Because He Could&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh and probing portrait of one of the most fascinating, and polarizing, figures of our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
