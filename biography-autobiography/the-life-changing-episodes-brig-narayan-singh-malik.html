  <title>The Life Changing Episodes - Brig Narayan Singh Malik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Commissioned in the famous Rajputana Rifles Regiment in 1964, Brig Narayan Singh Malik (retired) is a veteran of 1965, 1971 and 1999 wars. He was also rewarded for bravery in anti-insurgency operations in Nagaland. National Defence Academy alumni, he attended the Defence Services Staff College and Higher Defence Management Course. Besides holding the coveted appointments in Military Operations Directorates, Divisional and Corps Headquarters, he earned the unique distinction of serving in the Cabinet Secretariat on two separate assignments, including R&amp;AW. He is known for making laudatory contribution on many National issues (including Kargil), both in India as well as abroad. Whereas he faced severe health problems in the formative years, tenures in vital places in subsequent years were also interspersed by unprecedented encumbrances. How he could brush aside the impediments to reach the objectives is a story of perseverance sans seeking rewards. In postretirement period, he continues to indulge in educating people to develop progressive skills. The episodes are a reflection of pains and pleasures derived in life. Although he has taken up permanent residence in Australia, he continues to work towards development of concerned people in India by training them in Leadership, School Management, First Aid, Life Saving, Disaster Management and National Security." />
