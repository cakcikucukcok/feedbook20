  <title>Ladies Who Punch - Ramin Setoodeh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES AND WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like&lt;i&gt; Fire &amp; Fury,&lt;/i&gt; the gossipy real-life soap opera behind a serious show.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Barbara Walters launched &lt;i&gt;The View&lt;/i&gt;, network executives told her that hosting it would tarnish her reputation. Instead, within ten years, she&#39;d revolutionized morning TV and made household names of her co-hosts: Joy Behar, Star Jones, Meredith Vieira and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. But the daily chatfest didn&#39;t just comment on the news. It became the news. And the headlines barely scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on unprecedented access, including stunning interviews with nearly every host, award-winning journalist Ramin Setoodeh takes you backstage where the stars really spoke their minds. Here&#39;s the full story of how Star, then Rosie, then Whoopi tried to take over the show, while Barbara struggled to maintain control of it all, a modern-day Lear with her media-savvy daughters. You&#39;ll read about how so many co-hosts had a tough time fitting in, suffered humiliations at the table, then pushed themselves away, feeling betrayed--one nearly quitting during a commercial. Meanwhile, the director was being driven insane, especially by Rosie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setoodeh uncovers the truth about Star&#39;s weight loss and wedding madness. Rosie&#39;s feud with Trump. Whoopi&#39;s toxic relationship with Rosie. Barbara&#39;s difficulty stepping away. Plus, all the unseen hugs, snubs, tears--and one dead rodent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ladies Who Punch&lt;/i&gt; shows why &lt;i&gt;The View&lt;/i&gt; can be mimicked and mocked, but it can never be matched.&lt;/p&gt;" />
