  <title>A Cancer Survivor’S Physical and Spiritual Journey - A. Hodges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A. Hodges had been in excellent health for fifty-five yearsuntil 2004 when she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a rare cancer of the blood with a life expectancy of up to five years. Not only was she facing a terminal diagnosis, but she was also paralyzed from the waist down due to a tumor in her lumbar region, uncertain if she would ever walk again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hodges details the moments before, during, and after her diagnosis, she shares a glimpse into how quickly life can change in an instant. Determined to put one foot in front of the other and courageously face whatever came her way, Hodges reveals how she coped with her disease by maintaining a positive attitude, refusing to let hopelessness prevail, and steadfastly believing there was a reason for everything that occurs in life. As she moved through treatments, Hodges details her subsequent spiritual journey where she learned to trust in the Lord and appreciate the inevitability of Gods plan in every phase of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this inspirational memoir, a multiple myeloma cancer survivor shares the personal story of her courageous battle with a terminal disease and how she learned to rely on Gods wisdom for strength.&lt;/p&gt;" />
