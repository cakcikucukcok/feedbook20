  <title>Adultery &quot;Experience Was My Teacher&quot; - Spiritual Detox Ep</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes and most of the time, we feel like this house behind me - abandoned, rejected, mistreated, voided and most of all no love. 
We live in a society where truth is validated through people - a society in which love is desired through the flesh and rarely through the teachings of God. God can offer you far more than anything the world can give. He can teach you how to love yourself and how to not to seek it from others in this world. Searching for love from others prior to loving yourself can end in turmoil; wanting to fill a void in my naive life, yearning to be loved, lead me to loving a married man. Before I knew what was happening, my life began spiraling out of control. One of the worst mistakes I made in my young life. This box of love I received from him seemed so exciting and full of expectations from the outer appearance, but when I opened, it was nothing but emptiness and loneliness. I was committing a sin by being a married mans mistress as he was being the adulterer. God seemed to be the only outlet in helping me out of my situation. Through Him I learned to first love myself and how to love others. With those qualities and other teachings, God will send you a spouse and not the estranged, flesh-driven relationships the world will try to give you. Through Him you will develop the qualities of governing Kings and Queens. 
Hopefully my willingness to be transparent about past relationships sleeping with a married man and having an abusive husband can help you see the signs before you walk into estranged situations like I did. 
This book will teach you the art of how to love in every aspect. I hope this book helps you and inspires you to help others. Good luck and remember Proverbs 8: to acquire wisdom is to love yourself." />
