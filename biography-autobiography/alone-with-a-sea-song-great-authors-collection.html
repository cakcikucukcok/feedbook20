  <title>Alone with a sea song - Great Authors Collection</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katherine Mansfield’s life was short but her poetry and story deep. All those who saw her say she was beautiful woman. She seems very slender, with a round face, large deep eyes. Like a child — like her stories. All her life (and in her work) she had divided everything into &quot;the loveliness of the world&quot; and &quot;the corruption of the world&quot;. Her duty as a writer was to help drive away the evil and make the beauty known. This book present the story and poetry of Katherine Mansfield. Sea Song I will think no more of the sea! Of the big green waves And the hollowed shore, Of the brown rock caves No more, no more Of the swell and the weed And the bubbling foam. Memory dwells in my far away home, She has nothing to do with me. She is old and bent With a pack on her back. Her tears all spent, Her voice, just a crack. With an old thorn stick She hobbles along, And a crazy song Now slow, now quick, Wheeks in her throat. And every day While there&#39;s light on the shore She searches for something; Her withered claw Tumbles the seaweed; She pokes in each shell Groping and mumbling Until the night Deepens and darkens, And covers her quite, And bids her be silent, And bids her be still. The ghostly feet Of the whispery waves Tiptoe beside her. They follow, follow To the rocky caves In the white beach hollow...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
