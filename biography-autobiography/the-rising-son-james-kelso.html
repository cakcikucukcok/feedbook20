Like much else in the neighbourhood it has changed hands, changed names, and probably changed sex since then. Theres little left of what it once was. Hitler had his eyes on it at one time, or so it seemed. Not to buy it or to run it, just to bomb it. He didnt manage to destroy it though; he left that to the developers. For many of its customers the pub was a home from home. For others it was simply home. For one woman it was a private kingdom over which she ruled with a rod of kindness, though her reign began in bitter hatred. For others it was just a place of bitter, of brown ale, and stout and mild, of Scotch eggs and Muscado. Whats Muscado? Well might you ask. It was a kind of cola that acted like colonic irrigation on a kid whose favourite tipple it was. For some, The Rising Sun was a work place, for others it was a shelter, the centre of a community. For many, before and after the war, it was the still point of the turning world. The Muscado Kid, who was reared there, saw no point in it and couldnt wait to get away. Then he got away and couldnt wait to get back. Then many moons later, as the sun began to set, it dawned on him there was a story to be told. A story of Uncle Reg and Im here; of Big Pat and Dodger Green; of mass murder in a church; of tin baths and a haunting nipple; of Janaway and bit of bush; of a selfless sister and an adored Mum; of Dur-Dur and the several Mickeys. This is that story. The pub that was The Rising Sun closed long ago. Now, once again, its opening time. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
