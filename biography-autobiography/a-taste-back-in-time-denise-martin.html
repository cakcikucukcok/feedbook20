  <title>A Taste Back in Time - Denise Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Taste Back in Time, Recipes and true stories of Family, Friends, Faith and Food; is a compilation of humorous family stories often centered on food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering recipes from numerous relatives, there are recipes that date back many, many generations. &lt;br /&gt;
The Italian Culture is steeped in culinary tradition and the book sheds some light on the traditions and the important role that foods and celebrations play throughout life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book brings to light the belief that taking a taste of food that was enjoyed so long ago, instantly brings back fond memories of happier times. A time of Family, Friends, Faith and Flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the traditional foods and recipes seemed to have gotten lost amidst fast foods and chicken nuggets. Many of the long-held traditions that had sustained her in the past were almost non-existent in the fast paced 21st Century. In recapturing the memories that tie into the traditional foods, she rediscovered how these recipes could be adapted in todays kitchen&lt;br /&gt;
Hopefully when reading the book and trying the recipes you will feel and know that you are famiglia too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEASER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Author was close to death and had several out of body experiences that changed her spiritually forever. Many come through this type of experience and write about it; oddly enough Denise chose to write a cookbook replete with kitschy humor and family skeletons. Interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler Alert: About that tunnel  &lt;br /&gt;
Will be discussed in an upcoming book, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;" />
