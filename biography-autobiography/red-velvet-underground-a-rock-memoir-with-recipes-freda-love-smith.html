  <title>Red Velvet Underground: A Rock Memoir, with Recipes - Freda Love Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Part memoir, part cookbook, and all rock and roll, &lt;I&gt;Red Velvet Underground&lt;/I&gt; tells the story of how musician Freda Love Smith&#39;s indie-rock past grew into her family- and food-centric present.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smith, born in Nashville and raised in Indiana, is best known as the drummer and co-founder of bands such as the Boston-based Blake Babies, Antenna, and the Mysteries of Life. &lt;I&gt;Red Velvet Underground&lt;/I&gt; is loosely framed around cooking lessons Smith gave to her eldest son, Jonah, before he left for college. Smith compares her son&#39;s experiences to her own&amp;#151;meeting Juliana Hatfield and starting the Blake Babies, touring in Evan Dando&amp;#8217;s hand-me-down station wagon, and crashing with Henry Rollins, who introduced the band to local California fare&amp;#151;all while plumbing the deeper meanings behind the role of food, cooking, and family.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Interspersed throughout these stories are &lt;B&gt;45 flexitarian recipes&lt;/B&gt;&amp;#151;mostly, but not exclusively, vegetarian&amp;#151;such as red pepper-cashew spread, spinach and brazil nut pesto, and vegan strawberry-cream scones. Throughout the book, Smith reveals how food, in addition to music, has evolved into an important means for creativity and improvisation. &lt;I&gt;Red Velvet Underground&lt;/I&gt; is an engaging exploration of the ways food and music have informed identity through every stage of one woman&amp;#8217;s life.&lt;/div&gt;" />
