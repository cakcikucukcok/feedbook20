  <title>Dogtripping - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David Rosenfelt&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Dogtripping&lt;/i&gt; is moving and funny account of a cross-country move from California to Maine, and the beginnings of a dog rescue foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mystery writer David Rosenfelt and his family moved from Southern California to Maine, he thought he had prepared for everything. They had mapped the route, brought three GPSs for backup, as well as refrigerators full of food, and stoves and microwaves on which to cook them. But traveling with twenty-five dogs turned out to be a bigger ordeal than he anticipated, despite the RVs, the extra kibble, volunteers (including a few readers), and camping equipment. Rosenfelt recounts the adventure of moving his animal companions across the United States with humor and warmth, and tells the tale of how he and his wife became passionate foster parents for rescue dogs, culminating in the creation of the Tara Foundation and successfully placing several thousand dogs with loving families. &lt;br&gt;An NPR Best Book of 2013&lt;/p&gt;" />
