  <title>Clay in the Potter&#39;s Hands - Sheran Summers, Lois Clay, Rudy Clay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set amid the Great Depression and
World War II, a young man and
a young woman from two completely
different worlds meet only twice before
they start writing to each other during
the war. The letters bring romance,
but the atrocities of war change the
gentle man. Will he be the man
she falls in love with and, together,
can they erase the painful memories of the
war that still haunt him?
The coal mining towns and steel mills of
Southwestern Pennsylvania provide the backdrop
for this love story that spans almost a century,
from the 1920s into 2010. Take a ride as young
Rudy hot rods with his grandfathers horse and
buggy and wins the heart of his beloved Lois, as
they grow into the man and woman they were
meant to become.
Follow their footsteps and watch the divine
Potter at work, gently turning the clay on His
potters wheel, forming vessels full of love and
warmth, hope and passion, as these two young
people overcome their differences and start
making history of their own." />
