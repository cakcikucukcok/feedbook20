  <title>This Dummy Pulls His Own Strings - Dwight E. Knuth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, Dwight is a bit of a non-conformist or as his wife called him, &quot;A Rebel Without A Clue&quot;. He never got in any serious trouble but he liked to skate around the edge of it and occasionally his skates slipped and he fell into it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwight Knuth has always marched to his own drum while following a path through life lined with accomplishments, failures, joys, sorrows, and struggles. In sharing his fascinating true story that also reveals the history of his ancestors, Dwight hopes to encourage others to embrace their uniqueness and pursue happiness. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwight begins with his misspent youth where he proclaims he was a rebel without a clue. While providing a glimpse of what it was like to live on the North Dakota prairie during the fifties, Dwight details youthful adventures that include hitchhiking across the United States at age sixteen, being jailed twice during the trip, and then riding on a freight train to return home. As his journey led him to become a Golden Glove boxer, serve in the military during the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Vietnam War, Dwight discloses how he faced and overcame many challenges that would later include his wifes battle with terminal breast cancer. Through it all, Dwight teaches through example that perseverance and faith are keys to surviving and even thriving amid lifes greatest difficulties. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Dummy Pulls His Own Strings shares one mans experiences as he learned to navigate through life and embrace every good, bad, and ugly moment in his own distinctive way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
