  <title>My Unusual Stroke Story - Arianna Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women will have different symptoms than men in so many things, however; my symptom was 
very strange indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stroke caused me to have temporary disability; that is what I say to myself, although I 
do not have complete use of my right arm and leg, I consider it to be only temporary.  I can walk 
with the use of a cane now, and I can use my right hand for some tasks.  I have faith and have 
always projected complete recovery.  I always speak healing over my body, although I dont see 
the immediate healing like you see on T.V. I have never doubted about my healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my dreams I am always going about doing my chores and running errands in a 
complete state, I have never seen myself as been disabled. Thank God strokes can be treated and 
prevented, as long as you keep your blood pressure, cholesterol, and your blood sugar under 
control.  Always visit your doctor to get them regulated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was completely paralyzed on the right side of my body; I had no control of the muscles 
on the right side of my face, arm and leg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A heartening personal account of how one can maintain ones faith despite grave life challenges. Well-organized, charming work.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competently written, detail and narrative arc that would engage general readers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Blueink Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;My Unusual Stroke Story is an elevating and useful read for caretakers and thosestruggling with stroke recovery.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Clarion Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
