  <title>Breaking out of Treatment Court - Shawne Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story begins with the end of a run of the streets--the start of a new journey. It was the end of the summer of 2008 when I was done with my last run in the streets. I was selling drugs and also using drugs. I heard a voice. Actually, I had heard the voice ever since I was 18 years old. The voice shocked me to my core. It was almost like a dream. My grandparents raised me in the church, but I made a choice. Now Im walking in change. My mother-in-law was sick one day, and she went to the doctor. So she called me on my cell phone to pick her up from the doctors office. This is where my change begins." />
