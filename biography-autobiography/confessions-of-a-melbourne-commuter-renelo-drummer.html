      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Each entry has its own title based on the highlights for that day. For example, one entry is called Phlegm. There was this guy who coughed out his phlegm and spat it out on the train floor in front of another passenger. Another example is entitled B.O. A guy who was standing next to Renelo, put on his surgical mask and looked at him. Renelo thought that he was sending him a message that he had B.O. Renelo was pretty sure he showered that morning. He just ignored him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During the writing of this travel diary, Renelo realised that he was trying to force himself to be someone hes not. He doesnt like watching other peoples activities on the train. He certainly doesnt like to listen to other peoples conversations. He was doing it because he promised himself to complete this project. He doesnt want to start something that he cant finish, unless there is any plausible excuse.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Discover how Renelo went through the most embarrassing, disgusting, funniest and weirdest train travels.&lt;/P&gt;" />
