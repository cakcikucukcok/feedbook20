  <title>My Memoir Workbook - Marcia Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This memoir workbook demonstrates the importance of writing your story; it also gives you the tools and guidance you need to do it. Work at your own pace and say what you want to say in your own words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your book, designed to tell about your life in your own voice. The workbook provides you with inspiration, motivation, and encouragement to finish the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing your life story can be daunting and emotional, but it can also be fulfilling and rewarding. Share how you loved, cried, struggled, and survived with &lt;i&gt;My Memoir Workbook&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marcia Rosen is a miracle worker who could coax a memoir out of anyone. Inspiring and creative, she shows us how to shape our ideas and memories into a manuscript. With insight and humor, this book moves us all a few steps closer to our dream. And anyone who knows Marcia will recognize her warm and wise voice on every page.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pesi Dinnerstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Cluttered Life: Searching for God,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Serenity, and My Missing Keys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Having had no experience in writing, but with a burning desire to try to help people reach their goals, I asked Marcia Rosen to help me with the process. Let me tell you, that was the wisest decision I ever made. Marcia has a unique ability to explain the process and help you along. She is upbeat and very knowledgeable in writing and publishing. She will guide you, encourage you and direct your progress. I really could not have done my book without her. Thank you Marcia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
