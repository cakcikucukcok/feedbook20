      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain, &lt;em&gt;start working!&lt;/em&gt; Anyone who has heard a doctor say, Im sorry, its cancer understands this confusion. It was cancer  and it was happening to me. This made it a whole new experience. The emotions were raw, the fear was real, my faith was shaken, and the reality of my own mortality stared me in the face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everything seemed to go on as usual, but nothing was normal anymore. I wanted to shout at everyone, Dont you see life has changed? It will never be the same again?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;After surgery, I opted for prosthetics and early on was using the fiber-filled breasts. There was only one problem, and it was major! These things were too light. They kept moving up my body and hitting my chin. This was not going to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
