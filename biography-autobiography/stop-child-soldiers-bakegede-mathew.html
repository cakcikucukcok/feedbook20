  <title>Stop Child Soldiers - Bakegede Mathew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bakegede  MathewI just said I am not sure about Mary with my child and what will happen in the future. Because one day, I went to Mary Duds house to see my child. I found out she was making a call to somebody from Africa, from her tribe, in Dinka, and she talked with a guy about my child. After she was done, she gave me the phone. She told me, Somebody wants to talk to you right now on this phone. I took that call from the guy. And the guy said to me something about my child. He said to me, Mary, she is my sister. She just told me about you a few days ago, and you are not the father of my sisters child. I did say this to you because youre not from my tribe, Dinka. Before my sister gave birth to that child, I told her that when she will get that child, she has to name her on my fathers name because Bakegede  Mathew is not from the Dinka tribe. I did tell you that because that child has to be with me here in South Sudan. In the future, I will sell her to my tribe, Dinka, with lots of cows. I said this to my sister. RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY KNOW ABOUT MARY DUD is she is from South Sudan. Her tribe is called Dinka. This tribe is not a good tribe. I say this because the Dinka tribe has been abusing children from South Sudan for a long time. For example, when the kid got born, if she is female, they will take her to the village. She will never go back to the town again, not anymore. And when she becomes fifteen years of age, they will look for some man from the Dinka tribe to sell her for him with fifty cows, then the guy will take the fifteen-year-old as his wife and marry her. I think this is kind of the same way with Mary Dud. If they try to do it to my child, I wouldnt agree with that kind of thing. What I have to say right now is, after that crime would happen to my child, the court will find out about this. Thank you." />
