  <title>Passing the Baton - George P. Parsons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;About the Book&lt;/H4&gt;
Passing the Baton tells stories of the author experiences with the Baltimore Police Department, beginning with the tradition of passing the nightstick, or baton. Starting with his life as a small boy, and on through high school and a stint in the Navy, George Parsons chronicles what led him to his career with the Police Department. The stories follow his exploits in the many different divisions in which he worked, including patrol districts, K-9, the Marine Unit, the Emergency Vehicle Unit and the Arson Unit.  Some of the stories are serious, some are humorous, but all show what it is really like working the streets of a big city. You will also learn how he uses these experiences in his current position as an Instructor/Coordinator, helping young men and women realize their dreams of a career in law enforcement." />
