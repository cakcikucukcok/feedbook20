  <title>Am I the Prophet Elijah? - William Knox Mackenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a local man who is unable to work due to a disabling back injury caused in a truck accident in 2006, I am currently on the invalids benefit. &lt;br&gt;
I have a positive mental attitude and firmly believe that when one door closes another door opens.&lt;br&gt;
I also believe that knowledge is the key to a brighter future and the being inform will set you free.&lt;br&gt;
I seek the truth of my earthly existence and love in this world that is full of illusions and stubborn mind sets that do not accept change and growth.&lt;br&gt;
On my journey through life so far I have experienced highs and lows , from being suicidal at times to the exhilaration of being a top soldier, sportsman, father and contributing member of society.&lt;br&gt;
I regard family as the most important part in anyones life; it is the stage where you learn to be yourself and about unconditional love. You can choose your friends but not your family lol.&lt;br&gt;
I came from a large family of eight; I grew up pretty fast being the oldest male in the family as described in my first letter of my auto biography. I was guided by my ancestors and god to write so that others could learn from it. I am not a clever man I had 198 half days a whanganui boys college it was just good enough for me to pass the entry exam three times to join the army I was both a regular and then territorial soldier, when East Timor turned to violence in 2000 I reenlisted for the third time, but due to medical reasons I was not accepted for my third tour of duty.&lt;br&gt;
I am a spiritual being as well as flesh, the body is merely a vessel, my hope is that my book will inspire others of like mind or lost souls open there minds to one possible truth the truth that has captivated and inspired me all my life that we all are the children of a very loving god, creator  or supreme being." />
