  <title>The Quotable Darwin - Janet Browne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A treasure trove of illuminating and entertaining quotations from the legendary naturalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is Charles Darwin in his own words&amp;#8212;the naturalist, traveler, scientific thinker, and controversial author of &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;, the book that shook the Victorian world. Featuring hundreds of quotations carefully selected by world-renowned Darwin biographer Janet Browne, &lt;i&gt;The Quotable Darwin&lt;/i&gt; draws from Darwin&amp;#8217;s writings, letters to friends and family, autobiographical reminiscences, and private scientific notebooks. It offers a multifaceted portrait that takes readers through his youth, the famous voyage of the &lt;i&gt;Beagle&lt;/i&gt;, the development of his thoughts about evolution, his gradual loss of religious faith, and the time spent turning his ideas into a well-articulated theory about the natural origin of all living beings&amp;#8212;a theory that dangerously included the origin of humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Quotable Darwin&lt;/i&gt; also includes many of the key responses to Darwin&amp;#8217;s ideas from figures across the social spectrum, scientists and nonscientists alike&amp;#8212;and criticism too. We see Darwin as an innovative botanist and geologist, an affectionate husband and father, and a lively correspondent who once told his cousin that he liked to play billiards because &amp;#8220;it drives the horrid species out of my head.&amp;#8221; This book gives us an intimate look at Darwin at work, at home, as a public figure, and on his travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete with a chronology of Darwin&amp;#8217;s life by Browne, &lt;i&gt;The Quotable Darwin&lt;/i&gt; provides an engagingly fresh perspective on a remarkable man who was always thinking deeply about the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
