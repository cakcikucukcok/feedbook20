  <title>Proud to Be a Daughter of God - Bonnie Christler Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A simple ride to borrow a pickup from my family changed all the lives of our family in one short second. We were hit by a drunk driver and taken to the hospital. I had such extensive injuries that it was determined I should be flown by emergency helicopter to a hospital where a team of orthopedic surgeons would be waiting for me. Before I left, I was given a blessing and promised the Lord wanted to heal me quickly. Those words gave me strength.
	Once arriving at the hospital, I wanted to block it all out because it was too much for me to handle. I would talk to my loved ones coherently, but I didnt want to talk to anyone else. I closed my eyes and wanted to wake up after it was all over. A nurse finally got through to me that Id die if I didnt cooperate with them, and I joined the fight.
	It took all my effort to simply stay alive. I found strength in Bible stories, my faith, and blessings. After many surgeries, I went from intense pain to discomfort. Then I had to face a depression that went from gentle tears and sobs to deep moans and groans. I could feel my babys arms around my neck and heard him call for me, and I couldnt move. I saw my children and my husband and tears flowed nonstop.
	Finally, I was able to move again, and the depression faded almost instantly. I started moving my arms, and I progressed to be able to ring the nurses buzzer. In the next few days, I sat up for the first time, stood up, and started taking steps with support.
	It wasnt an easy process. My muscles had completely atrophied. My head swirled, like being on a tilt-a-whirl. With the help of a physical therapist, I was walking with minimal support quickly. However, next I needed to put weight on my arms to get out of bed. Muscles were attached to scar tissue, and Id get terrible cramps. It was like starting all over again, but with blessings and my physical therapist and orthopedic surgeon, who was never happy until he made me whole, I survived.
	I was told Id be in the hospital six months to a year. I left short of two and a half months. I was very weak, but I was going home." />
