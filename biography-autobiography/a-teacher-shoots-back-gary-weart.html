  <title>A Teacher Shoots Back - Gary Weart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Teacher Shoots Back&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how Gary Weart became a social studies teacher in the public school systems of North Carolina and lost thirteen students to violence.  With Angela Bynum, Gary started Students Against Violence Everywhere, or SAVE, with chapters extending to forty-four states and seven foreign countries.  
Working with mayors, governors, senators, congressmen, and two U.S. presidents, Gary worked tirelessly to encourage safe learning environments, homes, and communities.  In 1995, Gary received the Presidential Service Award from President Bill Clinton.  Now retired, his mission has expanded to promoting global peace and protecting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Teacher Shoots Back&lt;/i&gt; also provides insight into Gary Weart&#39;s many lifetime adventures: working in Army counter-intelligence; carrying the Olympic Torch for both the 1996 and 2002 Olympics; meeting members of the Green Bay Packers from the Vince Lombardi era; playing fantasy baseball under Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver; and teaching &quot;Slimnastics&quot; to an all-female class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this engaging memoir, Gary chronicles how the family values of his ancestors shaped the goals of his life and taught him honesty, friendship, and the necessity of cooperation.  It&#39;s the story of how one person can change the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
