  <title>The Greatest Father of All Times - Dr. Martin O. C. Anumba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book was written in connection with the life of my father, which I considered to be great indeed. It was great because he really worked very hard in building himself and the family through usage of his great intelligence at all levels. His high intelligence, actually, helped him to attain a high level in medical field, working in several communities. His profession as a dispenser and his personality as a really good man placed in a high position of recognition at all stages. As a result, he was placed in a position to not only help the community and the churches in all capacities but also he was so instrumental in building his family in general. His activities within the family, village, and the town, in general, proved to be second to none in our entire nation of Nigeria. Consequently, based on his accomplishment in the country, he is completely classified as the greatest father of times, with all kinds of information that we can learn from and also gain multiple knowledge and experience from. Sincerely, he was great and nothing more." />
