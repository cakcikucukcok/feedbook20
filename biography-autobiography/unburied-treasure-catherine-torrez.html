  <title>Unburied Treasure - Catherine Torrez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you wished that you knew things about your parents or grandparents when they were still with you? Now that they have passed, you have some memories but what if they had left you their thoughts, penned down with thought and care so that you would always have their advice and memories to cherish for generations? Have you ever considered taking the time to sit down with your parents and to write down all the many memories that meant so much to them or jot down those special tidbits of advice that they always have been so good to use that is their lifes experience perfected with time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is simply a format that lends itself to be a guide for one to simply jot down their thoughts on many subjects, just a paragraph at time. There are many given topics to write about, and then there are topics that one may select and choose to write about. Some topics are just ones memories or feelings that they had about special events or people. Some topics are how-to tips on their personal experience dealing with certain situations (gardening tips, fix-it tips, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an HONOR it is when your children ask for your advice! What love one feels when a child, grandchild, or loved-one receives a personal hand-written bit of memories, expressing their personal emotions, felt during special events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included is an expanded Family Tree that can easily be used to show not only your blood relatives but also the step relatives or adopted family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
