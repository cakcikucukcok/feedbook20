      <meta name="description" content="PRAISE FOR &lt;i&gt;CHALLENGED: A TRIBUTE&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Inspiring, encouraging, and a few surprises.  &lt;i&gt;Challenged&lt;/i&gt; is a well-written story that makes you laugh, cry and reflect on the good old days and the many positive changes in our field over the past 30 years. Steve Grieger has seen it all... Sharing his successes and challenges of everyday life!  &lt;br&gt;
--Mark R. Klaus, Executive Director, Home of Guiding Hands 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Written by someone with intimate knowledge of what it&#39;s like to be around grown-ups with mental retardation, this book will surely resonate among those in that difficult field who often feel that they are the ones who are &#39;challenged.&#39;  The book is highly humorous, which is part of its attraction.  When working with these individual, there are laughs in every day, and these happy moments cover up some of the tears and fears that caregivers feel for their fragile, special charges.  Kudos to Mr. Grieger.* &lt;br&gt;
--Barbara Bamberger Scott, U.S. Review of Books (*RECOMMENDED)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mr. Griegers witty and insightful book speaks to the heart of the human spirit.  Through a series of eye-opening adventures it presents a unique and fascinating world, one that deserves recognition, filled with the joys and heartbreaks of self-discovery It is an important contribution to the field of intellectual disabilities and other allied professions, and would make a wonderful addition to any classroom or home library. &lt;br&gt;
