  <title>East Hill Farm: Seasons with Allen Ginsberg - Gordon Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;#147;This was Allen Ginsberg,&amp;#8221; Gordon Ball declared after recounting intimate moments with the cultural icon and beloved Beat Generation poet on East Hill Farm, outside Cherry Valley, New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During the late 1960s, when peace, drugs, and free love were direct challenges to conventional society, Allen Ginsberg, treasurer of the Committee on Poetry, Inc., funded what he hoped was &amp;#147;a haven for comrades in distress&amp;#8221; in rural upstate New York. First described as an uninspiring, dilapidated four-bedroom house with acres of untended land, including the graves of its first residents, East Hill Farm became home to those who sought pastoral enlightenment in the presence of Ginsberg&amp;#8217;s brilliance and generosity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A self-declared member of a &amp;#147;ragtag group of urban castoffs,&amp;#8221; including Gregory Corso, Peter Orlovsky, Herbert Huncke, and the mythic Barbara Rubin, farm manager Ball tended to a non-stop flurry of guests, chores, and emotional outbursts while also making time to sit quietly with Ginsberg and discuss poetry, Kerouac, sex, and America&#39;s war in Vietnam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In honest and vivid prose, Ball offers a rare intimate glimpse of the poetic pillar of the Beat Generation as a striving and accessible human being at home on the farm and in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
