  <title>Does Everyone Get a Turn to Be God? - Nemo Tee Noon Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout his life, Nemo Tee Noon, MD has faced trouble and confusion with regard to sexuality and gender identity. Even more stressful have been his battles with mental illness and learning disabilities. Despite these challenges, he received his M.D. degree from St. Georges University School of Medicine, Grenada, West Indies in 1983, when he was 31 years old. He worked for two years as a psychiatric intern and resident, but suffered a nervous breakdown in 1985 and has been on disability since then. However, he did manage to earn a two-year brain wave (electroencephalography, EEG) technicians degree between 1986 and 1989. 
Moreover, he arrived at the conclusion that the mind and brain must be two different things, with the mind being a single particle that usually has its consciousizer switch turned on. The recent discovery (by physicists) of the God Particle, a particle that imparts mass to all other particles, tends to support Noons mind particle theory. According to his hypothesis, if God might be a single particle and you and I are made in Gods image, then it stands to reason that we, too (each of us Earthlings) might be a single particle, albeit temporarily trapped inside a burdensome, vulnerable body or brain-body pair.
He delineates how all past, present and future Earthlings will be rich, famous, brilliant, good-looking, etc. forever, starting at some time within the next 50 to 100 years. Also, how everyone could get a turn, sooner or later, to be God is touched on, in a preliminary way." />
