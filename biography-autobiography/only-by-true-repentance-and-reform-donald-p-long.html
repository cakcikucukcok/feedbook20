  <title>Only by True Repentance and Reform... - Donald P. Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book you will come to know my upbringing that details aspects of your son(s), brother(s) and nephew(s) life. An upbringing that maybe similar if not identical.
This book tells the journey of a young teenager growing up on the eastside of Detroit. Poor, drug addicted Mother, an absent of a Father. Like so many of our Black youth today. An upbringing that pressured me into a life of drug selling. Then eventually an assault with intent to rob and assault with intent to murder. I was later captured and sent to the Michigan Department of Correction for 18.7 years of my life.
This book will allow you into my 18.7 year journey as a prisoner. It will allow you to see the ups and downs and the good and bad that I had to struggle and cope with beginning at the age of 22. 
In the midst of a dark period in my life. I was able to find a life giving teaching that lead to my repentance from a criminal way of thinking. And the reformation of a criminal way of acting.
The reader will see that there is an answer to the pain and struggles within our youth today. And that committing a crime, going in and out of prison, neither dying a premature death is not worth the value of their lives.
If you are in prison then this book will let you see how I made it 18.7 years trouble free. I am one of those who was fortunate to make it out alive, well and with a sound mind. To let my young brothers and the world know. That its never too late to repent and reform, and to be a blessing to yourself, your Mother, your family and the world!
