  <title>Hot War, Cold War &amp; Beyond, Tales from the Trenches of the 20Th Century - Austin Goodrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last three-quarters of the Twentieth Century probably had more life-changing events than all previous history. Austin Goodrich reflects on the role he played in  driving this history to a successful conclusion in the interest of all he believed in.  From a quiet street in a quiet middle-class midwestern city, Austin was thrown  into the cauldron of World War II as an infantry man known in the old days as  a gravel-clutcher. After serving in both the European and Pacific Theatres in the  86th Blackhawk Division, Goodrich pursued his WWII promise to serve the  cause of world peace by joining the Central Intellegence Agency. The rest is history  as told by one who participated in his countrys first line of defense as a CIA  case offi er serving for most of his 25 years under non-official (deep) cover.&lt;/p&gt;" />
