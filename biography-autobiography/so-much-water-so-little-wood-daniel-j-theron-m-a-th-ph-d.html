  <title>So  Much  Water, so  Little  Wood - Daniel J. Theron M.A. Th Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To appreciate this book readers must grasp the symbolism of its title and the front page depicting the authors life story, sometimes in rough seas. 
At three/four years old he was already strongly aware that he had been called into the Christian ministry, an inspiration for a long, fruitful life. He grew up helping in their South African farm life. He commuted to grammar school on horseback, accumulating enough miles to ride three times from New York to California. It was a  financial struggle to become ordained as a clergyman.
His story is interestingly interspersed with several short, unbelievable biographies of classmates and what life was like. Read the The Sturdy Warrior, Chapter V and others like Albert Schweitzer of the Bushveld, and We Shall Triumph, in  the book mentioned below. 
With several well-earned degrees he migrated to the USA to study at Princeton Theological Seminary, where he became a professor. But then the delicate call that had driven him since childhood was smashed seemingly beyond repair. However, for him those called into Gods Kingdom can in its wideness find symbolic pulpits and lecterns in many places. Of all, he found such in Wall Street, and applied himself with the Latin sayings, strong command: age quod agis  Do what you are doing!
How is it continuing? Please find out in this books sequel entitled: Faith, Hope, and Determination." />
