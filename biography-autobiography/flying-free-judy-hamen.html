  <title>Flying Free - Judy Hamen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Judy Hamen was born in a hospital in South Dakota just before the start of World War II, when gas was eleven cents a gallon and the average life expectancy for a woman was sixty-five. As she grew into an energetic five-year-old, Judy had no idea that just days before her sixth birthday, she would become motherlessan event that would change the course of her life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her poignant memoir, Hamen details what it was like to grow up without a mother during a chaotic time in American history. Originally told her mother died from typhoid fever, Hamen discloses how it would not be until some twenty-five years later that she would learn the truth about her mothers death. As she shares her journey into womanhood, Hamen provides a glimpse into her unique life storymigrating to Minnesota in the 1950s, marrying at eighteen, and embarking on a diverse career that takes her from a secretarial job at a Ford dealership to Northwest Airlines, for which she trained airline mechanics in foreign countries. Included are illustrations and letters that bring her story to life and document important events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying Free shares one womans unique path through life as she overcomes adversity, breaks through barriers, seeks adventure, and finds spiritual inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;" />
