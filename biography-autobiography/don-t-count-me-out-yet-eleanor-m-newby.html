  <title>Don’T Count Me out Yet - Eleanor M. Newby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about my many battles
with cancer. I have had cancer six
times and I am currently on chemo as
maintenance for precaution measures.
In addition to cancer, I have had other
health issues over the years including
two complete knee replacements. This
book is also about my life and my
children and grandchildren and family,
but it is mostly to show people there is
life after cancer and to never give up.
I was born into humble beginnings in
a little town called Bluff City, Virginia.
I was one of six siblings. I had two
brothers and three sisters. I was the next
to last. We didnt have much growing
up, but we had each other and a lot
of love. I went to school in Narrows,
Virginia and graduated in 1964. I met
my husband, Roy, in 1967 and we were
married a year later after his tour of duty
in Vietnam. We had two boys, Randy
and Rusty, and three grandchildren. I
worked at a local factory for 37 years
until my retirement in 2004. I have
always loved to write. I have written
many poems and stories, mostly for
personal use. This is my first book, but
I felt I had a story to tell and I hope it
will encourage others who are either
going through the same battle or who
have been through it." />
