  <title>Starfish - One Family&#39;s Tale of Triumph After Tragedy - Tom Ray, Nic Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;There is a voice that whispers to me on the pillow. I have no idea if it is part of the dream, a hallucination, or reality. It talks of children, bringing news of a girl called Grace who loves me very much and a new baby boy called Freddie, who apparently needs me to get better... It stirs a part of me, even in my coma, reminding me that I&#39;m thirty-eight and in love with the most beautiful woman in the world. It tells me that one third of me is gone but what&#39;s left is enough; that the thing is, above all, to survive.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tom Ray put his young daughter to bed one chilly December evening, he had everything he could ever want - the house of his dreams, a beautiful wife and a second baby on the way. By the next morning all of this was in jeopardy as Tom succumbed to the devastating illness that is sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starfish&lt;/i&gt; tells Tom and Nic Ray&#39;s truly inspirational story of their life before, during and after the illness which claimed Tom&#39;s lower arms, legs, and a portion of his face. Heart-breakingly honest and affecting, their story charts the devastating effects of Tom&#39;s illness, Nic&#39;s heroic struggle to cope and, ultimately, the love and hope that has held their family together in the ensuing years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tragic yet beautiful tale of a couple whose love is tested to its limit after their perfect life falls apart in a single moment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
