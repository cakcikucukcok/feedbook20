  <title>Building Bridges and Roads in the Korean Conflict - Ronald H. Dykes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Building Ridges and Roads in the Korean Conflict tells the inside story of a combat engineers company from Scottsboro, Alabama, that served in the Korean &quot;War&quot;. The contributions of units such as Company B aren&#39;t always fully appreciated. In this book, Dykes demonstrates their importance in the conduct of that conflict.
Praise for the author&#39;s previous books:
For Growing Up Hard:
&quot;Reading Growing Up Hard is like sitting on the porch sipping a glass of cold iced tea while listening to a favorite grandfather tell stories of what it was like to grow up in more difficult times.&quot;-The Alabama Review
For James O. Haley:
&quot;You can&#39;t put the book down until you finish reading it for Dykes seizes your undivided attention.&quot;-Sen. Howell Heflin
&quot;I enjoyed it more than I can express. I really feel inadequate to comment on this excellent work.&quot;-Gov. Albert Brewer
&quot;Wonderful book&quot;-Trial Lawyers Association &quot;Thoroughly enjoyable&quot;-Birmingham Bar" />
