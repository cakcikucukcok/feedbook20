Everyone has heard of these sociopaths and their crimes, and yet, no one is scared of them. Why? Well for one, they’re all dead, but it’s more that -- after all, movie villains aren’t even real, yet people remain frightened of the bad guys on the screen long after the lights come up. No, what makes these criminals seem almost pedestrian is that we can see them for what they are; they hold no mystery. Dastardly though they were, they’re famous. They’re celebrities. For all intents and purposes, they’re Paris Hilton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The serial killers among us:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why are kids afraid of the monsters under their beds? Because what really shocks us is the unknown. It’s the commonality shared by Adnan from Serial and Jame Gumb from Silence of the Lambs: the criminals who blend in, who don’t stand out, are the ones that captivate us the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The banality of evil and crime:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Double Lives&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a book that chronicles those very monsters who walk unnoticed among us -- the neighbors and students, professionals and friends living out criminal double lives. It&#39;s a nonfiction expose and a search, that details the exploits of some of the worst serial killers in recent American history, all of whom succeeded in going undetected for years while perpetrating one gross crime after another… all in their own hometowns. Gender? Race? Age? Socioeconomic class? It doesn’t matter. All stripes of people from all walks of life are profiled within.&lt;/p&gt;
The Eagle Rock Arsonist. The Bath School Bomber. The Mountain City Murderess. The Black Belt Bank Robber of Philadelphia. 
What is it that makes these criminals so interesting? The monsters who walk unnoticed among us – students and neighbors, professionals and even friends leading criminal double lives – all capture our interest in ways that nothing else can.
Double Lives: True Stories of Crime and Addiction Across America begins with the author’s search for answers as to how people he’d known in high school, people he’d called friend, grew into adults who nurtured secret, criminal alter egos – and it evolves into a series of vignettes detailing how some of the worst Americans in recent history went undetected for years while successfully perpetrating one gross misdeed after another… all in their own hometowns." />
