  <title>A Dog Named Tractor - Dan Isom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New book is tribute to &lt;strong&gt;&#39;A Dog Named Tractor&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dan &quot;Mountain Man&quot; Isom recalls happy memories, shares love for animals, nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;BENNETT, Colo.  Life has not been always good for author Dan Isom. Just like the rest of the population, Isom has experienced both highs and lows in his personal journey. To exorcise the bad ones and highlight the good ones, he writes a tribute to &lt;strong&gt;&quot;A Dog Named Tractor&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (published by Xlibris) and reveals other stories of his life shared with nature and animals.&lt;p&gt;A self-confessed hunter, fisherman and cowboy, Isom has had many wonderful memories with the flora and fauna in his side of the world. This book being a tribute to his true friend and loyal business partner, Tractor, has a story that demonstrates how animals can be integral to man&#39;s everyday life, even to his happiness.&lt;p&gt;A confessed alcoholic as well, Isom tells how his sweet memories pulled him out of the bog alcoholism has put him in. A story of survival and overcoming his alcohol addiction meshed with his great time around nature and animals, this narrative sends a message that the good things in life always outnumber the bad ones.&lt;p&gt;Down-to-earth as he admits his dark side, Isom shows readers how they too can combat addictions and live life bathed in the beauty of the environment and its friendly creatures. Powerfully communicative amidst its simplicity as a narrative, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;A Dog Named Tractor&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; spreads the message of enjoying each and every moment spent around nature and considering every situation an added learning experience.&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Dog Named Tractor&quot;&lt;br&gt;By Dan &quot;Mountain Man&quot; Isom&lt;br&gt;Softcover - 6 x 9in - 70 pages - ISBN 9781499016192&lt;br&gt;E-Book - 70 pages - ISBN 9781499016185&lt;br&gt;Available at Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble&lt;/p&gt;" />
