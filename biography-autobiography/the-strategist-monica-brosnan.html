  <title>The Strategist - Monica Brosnan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote up my diary daily over many years, hence my memoirs. I had always promised myself that one day, I might just put pen to paper and write my story.
Initially, I had not known that my life would take many turns. Following my complete education, I worked in a superb environment in Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. I was married and lived in Dublin until some years later. My husband was given a lectureship following completion of a masters degree, also in Trinity College, which necessitated a move away from Dublin. I then was offered a research post in Zurich, Switzerland, which I accepted. A short time later, my husband was offered yet another lectureship in Switzerland. 
Some few years later, we together set up an international business institute in Switzerland, where we were joined by some Swiss and international staff. This project also required much travel to many countries. While on business and part holiday in Turkey, my husband died suddenly. I then had to take his place in the institute in Switzerland.
Some three years later, while on a ten-day holiday in Ireland, I met a most wonderful man; and we married shortly afterward. He too had a superb successful career, as you may read in my book. We returned to Ireland, retired, and spent many years traveling the seven continents, mainly by cruising for many weeks at a time to such faraway places as the North and South Poles." />
