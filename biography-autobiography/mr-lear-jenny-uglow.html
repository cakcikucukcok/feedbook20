  <title>Mr. Lear - Jenny Uglow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sparkling biography of the poet and artist Edward Lear by the award-winning biographer Jenny Uglow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Lear, the renowned English artist, musician, author, and poet, lived a vivid, fascinating life, but confessed, &quot;I hardly enjoy any one thing on earth while it is present.&quot; He was a man in a hurry, &quot;running about on railroads&quot; from London to country estates and boarding steamships to Italy, Corfu, India, and Palestine. He is still loved for his &quot;nonsenses,&quot; from startling, joyous limericks to great love poems like &quot;The Owl and the Pussy Cat&quot; and &quot;The Dong with a Luminous Nose,&quot; and he is famous, too, for his brilliant natural history paintings, landscapes, and travel writing. But although Lear belongs solidly to the age of Darwin and Dickens--he gave Queen Victoria drawing lessons, and his many friends included Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelite painters--his genius for the absurd and his dazzling wordplay make him a very modern spirit. He speaks to us today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lear was a man of great simplicity and charm--children adored him--yet his humor masked epilepsy, depression, and loneliness. Jenny Uglow&#39;s beautifully illustrated biography, full of the color of the age, brings us his swooping moods, passionate friendships, and restless travels. Above all, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Lear&lt;/i&gt; shows how this uniquely gifted man lived all his life on the boundaries of rules and structures, disciplines and desires--an exile of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
