      <meta name="description" content="Judas Duncan was born dirt poor. Through hard work, he manages to become a professor of criminology by the age of 25. His good looks and promising future all come to a crashing halt one day when he is arrested in his classroom. His story of struggle and forgiveness could have happened anywhere. Judas fights to prove himself innocent of a crime he didn&amp;#39;t commit, but instead ends up spending 18 years in prison.
