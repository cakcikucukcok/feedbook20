  <title>Jesus - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;We must begin our story of Jesus by granting him permission to surprise us endlessly....&quot; ---from the Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus of Galilee taught through stories, which even today contain the power to startle us out of our prejudices and preconceptions. Now Father Andrew M. Greeley, one of America&#39;s most beloved storytellers, examines the parables told by Jesus in search of a fuller understanding of the man and his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This engaging and informal collection of homilies reveals a Jesus whose simple parables carry profound lessons about the Kingdom of Heaven. Along the way, Father Greeley touches on such provocative topics as the significance of Jesus&#39;s Jewish roots, his deep and revolutionary relationship with women, &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/i&gt;. He also singles out the four greatest parables, which best illustrate the infinite love and mercy of the God whose kingdom began with Jesus and continues even today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a storyteller, Jesus often surprised his listeners with unexpected twists that challenged them to see the world in a whole new light. Father Greeley&#39;s insightful tour of the Gospels provides a fresh look at the parables that strips away centuries of false and mistaken interpretations to get at the essential truth of who Jesus really was and what he believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
