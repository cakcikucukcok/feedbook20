  <title>Primrose Path - Vincent M. M. Galici Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt&quot;&gt;Have you ever been enticed to believe in someone or something, only to be deceived? Primrose Path is an autobiographical account of the authors experience working in an organization founded and controlled by an individual, seconded by his family, and enthusiastically supported by his associates. But the problem is its a sham, one that is the very antithesis of what Christians are supposed to be about, more akin to a cult than being free in Christ. It is one of the most outstanding examples of a counterfeit in the Church ever depicted on the printed page. But theres more to it than that. It is the authors conviction that this story does not stand alone in what is going on today. He believes there are innumerable instances where similar shenanigans are prevalent affecting millions of lives. Yet, seemingly, no one involved in these situations exposes the corruption. Somehow they feel they are all alone and believe that no one would understand what theyve gone through because it is too extreme to be believed. It is time that evil wreaking havoc in the Church is exposed and that people learn they are not alone, that there is hope, there is healing, they can reconnect into the Body once again and go on being productive for the work of the gospel. For now there are millions of Christians without a church home and have little faith to be a part of any other, those who may watch TV Christian programming as a substitute, or go out into nature rationalizing theyve found God there. But community among believers is sacrificed and the potential for sweet fellowship is no longer a part of their thinking let alone in their plans. They walk a disillusioned group, yet each one alone, homeless. Yet, hope is on the horizon. Read the book and see. Its a true story broken down into three parts: 1) The day-to-day life of a charlatan; 2) a psychological analysis of him; and 3) walking the reader through the three-year journey. New strong churches are waiting to be birthed; other churches are waiting to welcome these believers back into the fold. Hope is waiting. Making that important step is only a decision away. Please make it today.&lt;/P&gt;" />
