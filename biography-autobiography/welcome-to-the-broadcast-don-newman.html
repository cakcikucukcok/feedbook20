  <title>Welcome To The Broadcast - Don Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Broadcast&lt;/em&gt;, titled after his famous greeting to the viewers of his highly popular program &lt;em&gt;Politics&lt;/em&gt;, journalist and broadcaster Don Newman writes about his many decades reporting on Canadian and international politics. He covered some of the most critical events of our time: more than a dozen Canadian federal elections; historic free-trade, energy and constitutional talks (including the failed Meech Lake Accord); Supreme Court decisions; U.S. presidential elections; and the Watergate scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in his first book, Newman shares stories about meeting and interviewing the political greats of the last half century, from a chance encounter with JFK to a cloak-and-dagger assignation with a man who said he knew too much about the Kennedy assassination, to the attempt by prominent members of the Liberal Party to dump their leader in the middle of an election campaign. Also featured in the book are stories from Newman&#39;s personal life, including the ups and downs he experienced during his journey to become one of the country&#39;s top political journalists.&lt;/p&gt;" />
