  <title>How the Ball Bounces - Eric DeWolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine growing up in an ethnically diverse, poor neighborhood with little hope for the youth that lived there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric DeWolfe doesnt have to imagine having grown up in South Rockport, Texas at a place known affectionately as Mexican Park. Most of these residents of Rockport were of meager means and some even on public assistance. DeWolfe and his friends had a hard time envisioning a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everything changed when the city built a small basketball court at the park in front of his house. It didnt take long for him to form his own team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a huge Boston Celtics fan, DeWolfe named the team in their honor. He could include or exclude whoever he wanted, but he rarely exercised his authority. Team members were all close friends from the South Side neighborhood in Rockport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only a hoop, ball, and dreams of transforming themselves into Magic, Bird, Jordan or Robinson, these kids would transform their mundane lives into lives worth living. Some would grow up and even get out of the neighborhood, but others would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youre a huge basketball fan who wants to relive your younger days and celebrate a love for basketball that youve kept into adulthood, then youll be inspired by the highs and lows in How the Ball Bounces.&lt;/p&gt;" />
