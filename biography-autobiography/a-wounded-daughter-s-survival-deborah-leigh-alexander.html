  <title>A Wounded Daughter’S Survival - Deborah Leigh Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For many years, author Deborah Leigh Alexander lived in denial. It was hard for her to understand how the emotional abuse she suffered during her childhood affected her adult life. In this memoir, Alexander takes a step back and relives her childhood in order to break free of the emotional bondage and to forgive, heal, and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Wounded Daughters Survival&lt;/i&gt; recounts her personal and family history and comes to terms with the dysfunction that permeated her relationship with her parents. Alexander narrates how she lived through many damaging and sometimes violent encounters in her formative years, including overwhelming feelings of rejection by her parents. Using personal anecdotes to illustrate how God has worked in her life, she shares her experiences with her faith and how she found comfort and guidance in the Bible and through prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This true and personal account sheds light on how emotional abuse truly damages lives. By sharing her experiences of survival, discovery, and healing, Alexander provides hope that a functional future is indeed possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
