  <title>Life Is Short and So Am I - Dylan Postl, Ross Owen Williams, Ian Douglass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heart, determination, and triumph&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a boy who fell in love with wrestling before he was able to walk. Born with achondroplasia, a condition that causes disproportionate dwarfism, Dylan Postl had endured multiple surgeries by the age of 12. And yet, he held on to the dream that he would one day become a professional wrestler. Ignoring the naysayers and against doctors’ recommendations, Postl began training in his teens, and he soon began appearing on local independent shows. Before he turned 20, he was signed by WWE to play the role of Irish grappler Finlay’s feisty sidekick, Hornswoggle, and remained a fixture in the company for a full decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of Postl’s adult life has been spent in the wild world of the wrestling industry, his is more than a story of a little person’s journey through a world of giants; it’s a memoir of elation and anguish, triumph and disappointment, and of how an endlessly positive outlook combined with the unwavering support of family and friends helped a long shot become a success in his industry and a loving, responsible father. &lt;/p&gt;" />
