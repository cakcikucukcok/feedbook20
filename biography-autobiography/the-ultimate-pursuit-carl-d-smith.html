  <title>The Ultimate Pursuit - Carl D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After high school graduation, Carl enlisted in the U.S. Navy, was assigned to Guam and there in a dorm found himself being offered heroin  for the first time. After multiple refusals to get high, he gave in once, which launched a 15-year downward spiral in his life. Carl became entrenched in the drug world as a heroin and cocaine user, smuggling drugs and living only for his next fix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personal experiences are brought to life from inside his maximum-security prison. &amp;quot;Drugs took me where I did not want to go, made me stay there longer than I wanted to stay, demanding more of me than I wanted to give.&amp;quot; He communicates what it felt like to be homeless, hopeless, and a convict lost on the very streets he grew up on. He did not care whether he lived or died... but a much higher power did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When all hope was lost and it looked as if he would die a dope fiend, an old friend wrote him in a letter while in prison about a Christian program called Teen Challenge. Here he would be loved, taught the Bible, and how to live a life free from drugs and the horrible life he knew. This poignant, true-life story will grip your heart as you journey with a man on The Ultimate Pursuit." />
