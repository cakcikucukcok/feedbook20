  <title>Boulders - Steven Briggs, Steven Briggs, Anthony Lyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Boulders: Life with Parkinsons Disease recognizes that the small obstacles of daily life pebbles when one lives with ones health intactcan become a field of boulders that demands planning and effort to traverse when one lives with an impairment. Steven Briggs has turned a series of personal narratives, originally shared at meetings of a support group for people living with Parkinsons disease, into this collection of stories.
By injecting a sense of humor that revels in observing lifes little incongruities and each persons endearing idiosyncrasies, Boulders helps its readers to place themselves in the shoes of the person with a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease. From that perspective, the stories cover making ones way through the various parts of a typical day: the intricacies of grocery shopping, gardening, bathing, managing home maintenance and safety, going out to eat, going to the doctor, enjoying hobbies, taking a road trip, and visiting the rec center.
You may have received a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease. You might know someone who lives with the disease. Perhaps you find inspiration in reading about how another person negotiates his or her way around the boulders that loom along lifes paths. No matter what brings you to pick up this book, you will find it entertains, educates, and inspires you to face the boulders in your own life with courage and a smile." />
