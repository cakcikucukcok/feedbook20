  <title>Nick Sanders: The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man: Volume 2: 1990-2008 - Nick Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;AFTER A HIGHLY reviewed first volume of Sanders&#39; life-story trilogy, this second book takes automotive autobiographical style to a different level. Again combining the literary history of his past, fused with his life long obsession with adventure, he produces a true story that reads like a novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is about motorcycling and lots of it. Cover to cover from the Atacama to Alaska, Syria and the Middle East, London to Cape Town and beyond and then back again. His family, his loves, dashed dreams, the redemption of an average man all fetch up in a stirring personal mix that marks Nick Sanders as a worthy storyteller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Nick the individual is the journey and for him personally, attached in spirit with a St.Exupéry or an Eberhardt, asking like Lindqvist &#39;how many muscles has a human life?&#39;he remains influenced by allegories of existence, and what it means for an ordinary man to try and understand his place in life. If Nick Sanders is an icon it&#39;s partly because he&#39;s still around. If the journey still continues its because the story&#39;s not yet completed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspired throughout with seminal works such as Pirsig&#39;s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Durrell&#39;s Quartet and work from Sven Lindquist, he has associated himself with &#39;outsiders.&#39; He was one. He still is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
