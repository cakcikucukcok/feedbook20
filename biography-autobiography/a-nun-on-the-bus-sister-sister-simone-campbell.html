  <title>A Nun on the Bus - Sister Sister Simone Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2012, Sister Simone Campbell and a group of fellow Roman Catholic nuns toured parts of the country to rally support against Congressman Paul Ryan&#39;s budget, a plan that cut vital social programs for the hurting poor and the struggling middle class. Prayer groups turned into rallies, and small town meetings became national media events. Sister Simone became a galvanizing force for progressives of all stripes and remains a driving force for programs and policies that support faith, family, and fairness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rooted in a deep spirituality of compassion and service, Sister Simone gives voice to the hunger, isolation, and fear that so many people in America are feeling right now and shows us how we can create real transformation in our communities and in our own hearts through the contemplative life of prayer. Powerful, inspiring stories from the Nuns on the Bus tour and from Sister Simone&#39;s own life offer readers a fresh vision for a lived spirituality that is at the heart of today&#39;s progressive Christian movements working for change. &lt;/p&gt;" />
