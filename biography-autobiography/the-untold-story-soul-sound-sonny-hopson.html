  <title>The Untold Story - Soul Sound Sonny Hopson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I don&#39;t know how many forwards start out as a letter, but I figured it would be the best way to get your attention. Im sure many of the books youve read and have added to your collection on Philadelphia history and local greats have had excellent insight to the workings of our fair city. But every story has a side story that often has as much or more importance to the outcome of that story Many heroes never get their 15 minutes of fame and are forgotten in the shadows of  the decades.
My father has had many adventures that are not in this book, and that still need to be heard. My dad has a way of giving you just enough information and just enough humor that when he finally finishes his shorts, you just yearn for more. Maybe one day he will enlighten us with all the rest of his experiences that have made him a great man and made me want for such greatness." />
