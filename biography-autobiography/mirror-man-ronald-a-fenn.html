  <title>Mirror Man - Ronald A.Fenn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is  a compilation of short vignettes describing certain seen observations from the point of view of one living in an unreal environment and unreal reality except for sometimes far too much of both. It tries to explain through a mental split of thinking the disorder of being black and white on a red and white flag which the flag of Nigeria was used to make a new flag for a young nation at peace. Some of  the book is autobiographical and some more involved in detailed analysis of control by technology and the human animal Man. It may seem to be rather complex and hard to read but one must understand I wrote the book in a psychiatric hospital being brainwashed to get back on my feet again. It spans a life time of observation in the nation of Canada as seen through an african who is white blinded by so many mindsets about colour and race and origins. Leaving everything behind that was most precious in Africa I have had to live this nation s reality as my own sight seen or unseen often misplaced or taken for granted or isolated and or used and abused." />
