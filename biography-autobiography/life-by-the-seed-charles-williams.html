  <title>Life by the Seed - Charles Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life by the Seed
Life by the Seed was written by Daniel Jones. The novel talks about his time spent in public school, specifically about his eighth-grade year all the way up to his twelfth-grade year and his final moments in the educational system. Daniel does talk about the times when he isnt in school, like how he hangs out with his friends or does things outside of school. He also talks to himself in a way in certain situations (which is basically on a constant basis) since he feels that nobody would truly understand what he is thinking about or would reject it. He mentions his current significant other and how they met each other as friends, which eventually turns into something more early in the novel, and how they maintain the relationship through the course of the novel." />
