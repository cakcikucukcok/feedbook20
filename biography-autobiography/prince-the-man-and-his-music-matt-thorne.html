  <title>Prince: The Man and His Music - Matt Thorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;The newest, most updated book on Prince available today&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Famously reticent and perennially controversial, Prince was one of the few music superstars who remained, largely, an enigma&amp;mdash;even up to his premature death on April 21, 2016. A fixture of the pop canon, Prince is widely held to be the greatest musician of his generation and will undoubtedly remain an inspiring and singular talent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This meticulously researched biography is the most comprehensive work on Prince yet published. Unlike other Prince books, this one eschews speculation into the artist&#39;s highly guarded private life and instead focuses deep and sustained attention exactly where it should be: on his work. Acclaimed British novelist and critic Matt Thorne draws on years of research and dozens of interviews with Prince&#39;s intimate associates (many of whom have never spoken on record before) to examine every phase of the musician&#39;s 35-year career, including nearly every song&amp;mdash;released and unreleased&amp;mdash;that Prince has recorded. Originally released in the UK in 2012, this first US publication of &lt;I&gt;Prince&lt;/I&gt; includes updated content detailing the artist&#39;s two 2014 albums, tour, 2015 Tidal release, and other career events.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This astonishingly rich, almost encyclopedic biography is a must-have for any serious fan of Prince.&lt;/div&gt;" />
