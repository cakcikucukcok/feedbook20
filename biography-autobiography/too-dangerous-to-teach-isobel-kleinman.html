  <title>Too Dangerous to Teach - Isobel Kleinman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Readers will laugh, cry and rage as Elizabeth Feinman, passionate about her job, her students and the issues of the day, tumbles from grace the more deeply involved she gets in trying to improve all three. 
&lt;P&gt;Set in a junior-senior high school in the nineties, this story reveals what passes for standards and discipline and how a school administration, eager for national attention, can cook the books, shut down criticism, avoid critical evaluation and rid itself of whomever it cares to.  The narrative, which spans four decades, touches on raising the mantel for women, introducing sports to girls and adapting to societal changes.  It then follows a school district&#39;s efforts to rid itself of a thorn in its side.
&lt;P&gt;As Ms. Feinman stands up to career ending challenges, readers will no longer  believe that teaching is easy; teachers don&#39;t care; top-down management improves what goes on in classrooms; tenure protects teachers; and that a strong professional association is unnecessary if teachers are good at what they do." />
