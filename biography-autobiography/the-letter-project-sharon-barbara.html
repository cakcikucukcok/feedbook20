  <title>The Letter Project - Sharon Barbara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I dont feel so good today, Svensk. My chest hurts, headaches and nervous as hell. I was just thinking today, that you might not accept this wreck that the army will turn back to you after the war. I wouldnt blame you if you didnt. (September 1, 1944)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharon Barbara was born in 1948, three years after her father was discharged from a military psychiatric hospital. His nervous condition was a mystery to her and a secret source of shame she couldnt bear to acknowledge, that is, until she read his letters. The box containing the letters that her father wrote to her mother between November 1942 and April 1945his time in the service during WWIIhad been right under her nose for years, in the closet of her childhood bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Letter Project&lt;/i&gt; began as a simple preservation task, but over time, it became a memoir as one question led to another. The authors inventive approach of blending memoir, letters, and fiction, culminates in a captivating story of a daughters journey through her familys past to find freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by letters her father wrote to her mother before and after D-Day, &lt;i&gt;The Letter Project&lt;/i&gt; offers us a beautifully written portrait of Barbaras own battles with self-doubt, depression, and loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
