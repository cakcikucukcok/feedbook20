Now in &lt;em&gt;My Name Is Love&lt;/em&gt;, Darlene is ready to tell her tales about Elvis coming on to her backstage during his famous &amp;#39;68 Comeback Special, about wild parties she witnessed at Tom Jones&amp;#39;s house, and about her love affair with Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers. She also recalls how she found herself cleaning houses in Beverly Hills, heard herself on the radio, and vowed to make a comeback. That comeback has included roles in all of the &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; movies, starring roles on Broadway, and headlining concert appearances worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dishy, behind-the-scenes showbiz memoir, &lt;em&gt;My Name Is Love&lt;/em&gt; is also the inspiring story of a woman who refused to give up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
