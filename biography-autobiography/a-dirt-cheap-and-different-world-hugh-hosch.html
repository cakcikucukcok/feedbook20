  <title>A Dirt Cheap (And Different) World - Hugh Hosch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt do than by the things you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Dream. Discover.Mark Twain
Hugh Hosch took that advice as a young man, and many years later, hes glad he did.
In 1959, he paid $1.80 to travel 1,100 miles by train across the southwestern part of Brazilmeeting unforgettable characters along the way.
In Rio de Janeiro, at the great jewelry firm of Sterns, he bought his mother a pair of amethyst and gold earrings for $7. When he returned many years later bearing his original sales receipt, he found the same earrings cost $3,500.
In London, he could find a nice room for $2.80 per night, which included an English breakfast of eggs, sausages, rolls or toast, and coffee or juice.
From South America, to Britain, to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and elsewhere throughout the world, Hosch relives his many adventures in A Dirt Cheap (and Different) World." />
