  <title>The Lucky Generation - Brian R Sumner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Author was born  just post the second world war-a member of the so called Baby Boomer  Generation in London  .During the book he describes to us what life was like growing up in those far off , and very different ,days .  Whilst at its core the Book is autobiographical , it is much more than that. It has both comedy and tragedy and is  full of well researched facts on many of the events of the 50s , 60s and 70s and beyond  that have touched his life and the  prevailing Zeitgeist  of those years .It seeks to inform in many areas. Brian is a successful businessman and entrepreneur , having  been a Director of several Bank Subsidiaries and founded three companies. He  shares the business lessons that came to guide him in his career. There have been hardships  he has suffered from a severe clinical depression - and the book opens with his moving and harrowing account of what this debilitating illness can be like at its most extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book goes on, in an extremely frank and honest way ,  to describe  his hilarious  early experiences as a teenager looking for sex and love ,   his  story of his accomplished work and rugby football  careers , his topsy turvy  experiences  of sailing , skiing and amateur dramatics , his views on  marriage and fatherhood , and relationships with women in general , again providing us with both insight and humour throughout !  He discusses his strange   journey from Born again  Christian , to Atheism, and the forces that drove him from the one extreme to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along Brians lifetime journey  we laugh and cry with the author , who has enjoyed much success , happiness and fulfilment in his life in spite of the ever present danger of Depression .&lt;/p&gt;" />
