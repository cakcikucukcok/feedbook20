  <title>The Senior - Don Yaeger, Mike Flynt, LeBron James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;It’s Never Too Late to Tackle Your Dreams!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mike Flynt was swapping stories with some old football buddies when he brought up the biggest regret of his life: getting kicked off the college team before his senior year. So, one of his pals said, &quot;Why not do something about it?&quot; Most 59-year-olds would have laughed. Flynt&#39;s only concern was his eligibility. He not only returned to college football, but actually made the team at his alma mater - Sul Ross State, an NCAA division III school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarkable story begins with a tough upbringing by a violent father who trained him to fight at every opportunity. His fighting habit took him in and out of jail several times, until a faith conversion turned his life around on the very day he was contemplating suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Flynt has much to offer others, not only through his story, but through his belief that it’s never too late for God to heal your heart and fulfill your dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreword by NBA Superstar LeBron James.&lt;/p&gt;" />
