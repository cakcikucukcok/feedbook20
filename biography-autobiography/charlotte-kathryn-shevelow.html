  <title>Charlotte - Kathryn Shevelow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The life of actress Charlotte Charke transports us through the splendors and scandals of eighteenth-century London and its wicked theatrical world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her father, Colley Cibber, was one of the eighteenth century&#39;s great actor/playwrights-the toast of the British aristocracy, a favorite of the king. When his high-spirited, often rebellious daughter, Charlotte, revealed a fondness for things theatrical, it was thought that the young actress would follow in his footsteps at the legendary Drury Lane, creating a brilliant career on the London stage. But this was not to be. And it was not that Charlotte lacked talent-she was gifted, particularly at comedy. Troublesome, however, was her habit of dressing in men&#39;s clothes-a preference first revealed onstage but adopted elsewhere after her disastrous marriage to an actor, who became the last man she ever loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Shevelow, an expert on the sophisticated world of eighteenth-century London (the setting for classics such as &lt;i&gt;Tom Jones &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Moll Flanders&lt;/i&gt;), re-creates Charlotte&#39;s downfall from the heights of London&#39;s theatrical world to its lascivious lows (the domain of fire-eaters, puppeteers, wastrels, gender-bending cross-dressers, wenches, and scandalous sorts of every variety) and her comeback as the author of one of the first autobiographies ever written by a woman. Beyond the appealingly unorthodox Charlotte, Shevelow masterfully recalls for us a historical era of extraordinary stylishness, artifice, character, interest, and intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
