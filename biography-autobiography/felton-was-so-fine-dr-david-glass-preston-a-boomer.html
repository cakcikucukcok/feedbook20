  <title>Felton Was so Fine - Dr. David Glass, Preston A. Boomer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Caption:  Confused, as usual, in Ramponis Algebra Class, 1958 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(To the right of the picture): &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(The Rev. Dr.) Dave Glass has two home villages.  His well-received previous book, Aptos was Idyllic, chronicles his childhood where his mothers family resided.  He then spent his teen years in the Felton area, where his fathers family has lived since the 1860s.  This book provides a detailed and whimsical description of Felton half a century ago, with colorful, previously unpublished memories of up to 100 years ago and earlier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Praise for Aptos was Idyllic on Amazon.com: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
X	Great book with charming short stories about growing up mid-century. . . .  A must for anyone who lives or has vacationed on the California coast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Boofy &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
X	K an amusing and engaging reflection on growing up in the wild-to-a-kid west of small town CaliforniaK. You will laughK and have some nostalgic moments that linger. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
