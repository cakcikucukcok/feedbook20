  <title>Fight to Clear Barry George - Mike Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I first heard that Barry George was arrested for the murder of Jill Dando, I was shocked, but did not think that he was guilty. I decided that I would offer Barry and his mother my unconditional support, which was accepted. I helped him to get a good defence team and followed the case with close interest. 
I thought the Crown might produce hard evidence at the committal hearing and was horrified when he was sent for trial on the little evidence which they had. When, seven months after his arrest, the Home Office bowed to pressure and finally allowed me to visit him, I became a regular visitor. I was there when he was convicted, and the following day, I told the UK that he was innocent. A rift in his supporters then opened, but we all had the same aim, justice for Barry. One day, a respected reporter asked me: If Barry did not kill Jill Dando, then who did? I had never given that any thought, but I would, in the future. What I discovered was disturbing, and I came to believe that the real killer may have slipped under the radar while potentially vital evidence was ignored, the crime scene destroyed, red herrings chased, as the trail went cold. 
Following Barrys failed appeal, I set up website and later formed a small but well supported campaign group. We took every opportunity to highlight doubts and discrepancies. After a few bleak years, with our help, the BBC Panorama exposed serious flaws in the Crowns case. We were on the road to victory, and two years later, we arrived. Barry and I then went our separate ways but reconciled eventually. 
But this story will not end until the murder of Jill Dando is properly solved or explained. I have not given up hope on that, and I would like to think that this book might inspire the powers that be to have a more in-depth review of all the evidence, old and new. Not to do so would be remiss of them and an affront to justice.
