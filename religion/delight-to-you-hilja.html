  <title>Delight to You - Hilja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For those who chose to read this book, the intent herewith is to show you how you can have delight for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had many experiences in my life. I want to share these experiences; it is the best I can offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time to read and to think. You have all the resources you need to make the best of your life. You must seek, seriously, to find the delight of your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read good authors books, we learn knowledge from these authors through their writings. Often we find what we are looking for, and even more! This is what makes life delightful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not perfect, and can become confused by things we experience in life. There are answers for everything, and all the means to solve problems, by studying the truths in your life. You will find that you already know the answers but you have to think. Thinking is hard work! I have learned this from Socrates the Greek philosopher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all those who read this book, I pray and wish you all the best from Heaven above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;
The Author, H.R.S. &lt;/p&gt;" />
