  <title>The Hyde Park Mission Story Lives On - Joyce Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the 125th birthday of Womens Missionary Union, (WMU). In March 1888, the women doing missions all over the states and territories banded together and organized, in order to make more of an impact on world missions. As you will learn in Lillian Browns historical document in this book, (complete with references) Texas women had been doing foreign missions for several years previous to 1888, but joined in the bigger organization with the ladies back East. Hyde Park Baptist Church was begun June 1, 1894, and the women began their mission organization December 1896.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this writing, March 13, 2014, it was last year that I read the book The Story Lives On by Wanda S. Lee, Executive Director of WMU, and somehow heard a voice in my head, Joyce, you can do this. So I began collecting mission stories and gathering some historical stories from my fellow Hyde Parkers, to honor this calling and hopefully to inform our Staff and members of whats going on at Hyde Park Baptist Church outside the worship center. I pray to God our mission story does live on until Jesus comes again!&lt;/p&gt;
