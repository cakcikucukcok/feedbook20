  <title>Consecrated Soldier - Taiwo Adoti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul says to Timothy in his second letter of the same name in verse 4:
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. (2 Tim. 2: 4)
As soldiers of Christ, this statement is so hard for us to sometimes reconcile to, because it seems that life (especially if you are married) conspires against us from ever being able to fulfil this verse of scripture. So this book is dedicated to all those soldiers who have become entangled and seek to break free so that they can become lawfully effective consecrated soldiers of Jesus Christ, in Jesuss name.
