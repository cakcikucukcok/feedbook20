  <title>Black &amp; White Faith - Alison Dmytryshyn-Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The supernatural world is often shrouded in mysteryand we here on the earth are left riddled with questions. Does God speak to us? Are demons real? Can sickness be the result of my own actions, behaviors, and beliefs? And is heaven real, can people actually see into this otherworldly realm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Black &amp; White Faith, author Alison Dmytryshyn-Daniels steps out into the mystery and shares the intimate details about how God has touched every part of her world. From being healed of chronic illness to being witness to supernatural movementseven watching her father meet Jesus in the tunnel of death and then watching him ascend to heavenly glory after passing on from this lifeAlison reveals how God cares about every detail of our lives. But even more, Alisons journey shows us how God is there to walk with us through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to believe what you read in the Bible instead of dwelling in the gray area of human interpretation and reading what you believe. Black &amp; White Faith will help you understand this truth with purpose, and with it the totally real and fully alive God will move supernaturally in your life too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
