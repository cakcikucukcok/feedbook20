  <title>Thank You Lord for Saving My Soul - Jim Davenport</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The lead article, provides unique insight into the lives of Seth and Bessie Sykes, evangelists and song writers of the song &quot;Thank You Lord for Saving My Soul.&quot; Other topics include the sufficiency of God&#39;s grace, His purpose for man&#39;s creation, His role as comforter, His strength and His faithfulness. A number of articles relate the story of how the brief life of the author&#39;s great grandson and that of his parents had such a significant impact on so many lives. Several articles resulted from the author&#39;s personal life experiences including the emotions involved in moving on from a loved home and lifetime church. Other articles touch on heroes of the bible, a debt you can never pay, Paul Harvey&#39;s radio broadcast of &quot;If I Were the Devil,&quot; and experiencing the indwelling life of Christ. This is the third in a series of books by Jim Davenport dealing with the general topic of Christian Devotions and Quick Studies, which was the title of the first volume. The second volume is An Attitude of Thankfulness." />
