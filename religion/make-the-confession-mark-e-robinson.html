  <title>Make the Confession - Mark E. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Make the Confession I am Healed in Jesus Name is written as a tool and resource encouraging believers of Christ to tap into their supernatural inheritance which was made possible because of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Sickness remains in the earth realm because God has not called His children home unto eternal heaven, and the last enemy (death) has not been destroyed.  (1st Corinthians 15:26)  Christians must know their ancestral heritage, the Creator and architect of the gift of healing, God the Father.
The Lord Jesus Christ has called us out of darkness, and has placed
us into His marvelous light.  In the light of God dwells the fullness of
God the Father.  Well, if we dwell in the fullness of God, than there is
no other choice other than believing that God can, and will heal every
sickness and disease that encroaches upon our bodies, according to
the faith that we exercise in His word.  In the fullness of God dwells
excellence which translates into good health, and healing.  Make
the Confession, I Am Healed.
This is not a disclaimer to ignore medical practitioners prognosis,
advice, or the use of legalized prescribed medication, however, this
book is intended to encourage believers to apply their faith when
medical illnesses and injuries present themselves.
Christians should seek medical assistance routinely, plan annual
physicals to ward off sicknesses through the education and
familiarization of our bodies.  Being intimate with the condition of
your body defies or deters premature death, and long term illnesses. 
Be encourage, because we have a promise that God will satisfy us
with long life. (Deuteronomy 28)
God desires that we live in good health and prosper even as our soul
prospers. (3 John 2)" />
