  <title>Many Are Called but Few Are Ready - Jeremiah Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you know Jesus? Because you attend church? Because you operate in spiritual gifts? Because your life has changed for the better?  Those may seem like cynical questions until we take a closer look at the scriptures.  Matthew, the seventh chapter, makes it clear that many churchgoing men and woman, who operate in spiritual gifts, will be rejected by Jesus because they dont know him. They had cast out devils or operated in deliverance ministry, healed the sick, and done many great works, yet they knew not the one in whose name they were doing it in. It is possible to answer the call without knowing the One who called you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this insightful and groundbreaking book, respected author, prophet, and teacher Jeremiah Merritt shares with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*How to discern and recognize the biblical Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*How to practically apply being a son of God, in the earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The role of sanctification in our relationship with Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The satanic role of false prophets and teachers in keeping unsuspecting men and woman in the church from knowing who Jesus really is&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;*Understand the difference between God preserving us from wrath, or reserving us for wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will walk away from your experience with this book being able to biblically and accurately discern your relationship with Jesus Christ, and have a divine, spiritual confidence to know where you stand with him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
