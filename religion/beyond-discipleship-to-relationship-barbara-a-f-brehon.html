  <title>Beyond Discipleship to Relationship - Barbara A. F. Brehon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to grow and wants to help others to grow in the Lord will find a practical approach within Beyond Discipleship to Relationship. Are you interested in growing a more intimate relationship with Christ?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you first decided seriously to follow Jesus. Was it initiated in the midst of a crowd or during an intimate talk with one or two other believers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Discipleship to Relationship was written to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	inspire individual intimacy with the Lord&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	initiate shifts or revitalize your lifestyle as an imitation of the Gospel story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	delve into particular events in the Bible, pausing for further reflection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	nurture desire that others will see Christ in the lives we live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 100:5 And His truth endureth to all generations. Gods truth dwells in you. It is my belief that to Gods glory your work will magnify Him. Thank you for allowing me to be a small part of that process.&lt;/p&gt;
