  <title>Walking as Children of Light - Carol A. Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A woman, age twenty-two, with two small children and married only five years, sits watching a campfire when she suddenly becomes aware that she is no longer married. Another time, she is out to dinner with a friend, only to be urgently sent home to save her dying son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walks along a beautifully landscaped boulevard, notices a church with stained-glass windows, and finds God speaking to her. Her daughter is away at college when a dream warns her she is going to lose her to a horrific accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One minute she is folding clothes beside her bed and the next watching Jesus observing the whole Earth. Working in nursing, she gets a heads-up about a difficult night, and another time, some creative help with a sewing problem, as well as deliverance from an addiction that was going to end in her suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things happened. I know, because I am that woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us to tell others what wonderful things God has done for us: Publish his glorious deeds among the nations. Tell everyone about the amazing things He does (Psalm 96:3). &lt;br /&gt;I have learned many things since being that twenty-two-year-old at the campfire, but most of all I have learned that God is love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
