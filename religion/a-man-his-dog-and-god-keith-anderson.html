  <title>A Man, His Dog, and God - Keith Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God, who protects and guides us all, has created in the animal kingdom something that amazes us all. In A Man, His Dog, and God, author Keith Anderson uses short stories and vignettes focusing on his dog, Bear, and their time together. He recalls how his close relationships with Bear; with his wife, Betty; and with God have sustained him during a most difficult time in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with stories of Bear and of other animals, Anderson shares his love of the Suwanee River, and how watching the cool waters gentle flow can help ease obligations. He also tells the story of his wifes battle with cancer. His recollections range from funny and joyful to poignant, touching so many aspects of Gods creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories in this collection make connections between Bear and his position with God to encourage you in your faith. God has an eternal love for His people, and He uses all His creatures and creation to convey that love to us. In a Man, His Dog, and God, Anderson felt the Lords call saying:  I want you to tell a story using Bear and his experiences to tell my children how much I love them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
