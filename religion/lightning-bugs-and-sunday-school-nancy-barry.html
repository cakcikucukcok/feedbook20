  <title>Lightning Bugs and Sunday School - Nancy Barry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; As comfortable as telling stories around the kitchen table, on the front porch, or in front of a campfire, Lightning Bugs and Sunday School presents a collection of narratives, points to ponder, and poetry that illustrates how God works in the lives of the faithful. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Compiled by author Nancy Barry, the stories include appearances by angels and good Samaritans, prayers that have been answered, and the witnessing of unexplainable miracles. In Great Balls of Fire, Shirley Jones tells how listening to a message from God saved her house from ruin during a storm. In A Smooth and Quiet Ride, Daniel Street describes being rescued by an angel on a bitter night when his vehicle broke down. Sometimes You Have to Ask relates how a prayer for a boys new eyeglasses was answered by a thoughtful neighbor.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With recipes and household hints included, Lightning Bugs and Sunday School offers a plethora of faith-based stories and recollections that provide inspiration and guidance.&lt;/P&gt;" />
