      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jesus Answered with Twelve Little Boxes&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Eileen Youngs life as a single parent with two children. She writes about the true experiences and challenges that she and her children faced. During this period in their lives, they experienced humbling and stressful events, but they also felt the hope that having Jesus in their lives brought to them. His love made it possible for them to go on and to have joyful and successful lives. Even during the worst times, they believed in Jesus and knew that He was there for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Eileens divorce, they experienced very tough times. As Christmas drew near, she had no job and no prospects for one; whats more, unbeknownst to her children, she faced losing the family car and being evicted from their home. Faith carried them through, however, because they focused on what they were grateful for and their future hopes and dreams. It was from that strong faith that the gift of the twelve little boxes was borna gift that her children would cherish for the rest of their lives. From that Christmas came a family tradition that lives on today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jesus Answered with Twelve Little Boxes&lt;/i&gt; is a story of courage and an unshakable faith in Jesus that makes all things possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
