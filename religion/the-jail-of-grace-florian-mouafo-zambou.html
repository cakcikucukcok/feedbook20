  <title>The Jail of Grace - Florian Mouafo Zambou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many have had a genuinefalse conversion experience, a vain hope that promises life while progressively taking it away, these are seeds that sprout without ever bearing fruits, trees that cumber the ground and need to be cut down at the root. This book endeavour to evince the contrast between a new creature and a zombie. Zombies invasion is occurring in the midst of the children of the Lord, from pulpits to pews hardly is found someone who has The Life of God in his soul. Behold an allegory, that will help you find out, who really is your father and whether you were born in the womb or in the tomb. Beware, lest you mistaken who is your genitor as the Jews of old, do not flatter yourself by your pedigree, feelings, experience, activities, and so on For God will not collect his jewels by their appearances, He will test them by FIRE. Therefore, it is what you are right now which counts for Eternity, for in whatever condition you die you eternally remain. Thus, were it not for the ongoing transformations in my life, I would never believe the testimony of my conversion." />
