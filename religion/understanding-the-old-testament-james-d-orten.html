  <title>Understanding the Old Testament - James D. Orten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Written especially for those who have found the Old Testament confusing, this book explains the essence of it in clear, readable language. The author, a university professor, believes that mental preparation for what is ahead promotes understanding. Thus readers are given a brief preview of each section that alerts their minds for material and concepts to come. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Part One opens with a mental framework for comprehending the Old Testament.  It discusses the problems many readers face, gives internal and external evidence that the history of the Old Testament is trustworthy, and takes the reader on a walk with Abraham through the geography and culture of the O.T. world. Part Two begins with creation and covers the first 2500 years of human history ending with the enslavement of the Jews in Egypt. The spiritual significance of these great events for modern readers is explained by examples of how God&#39;s actions in one age foreshadowed those to come in later times. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The drama of God&#39;s historical relationship with man is continued in Part Three by walking with the Israelites on their exodus from Egypt, God&#39;s appearance to them in the desert of Sinai, and their conquest of Canaan. Puzzling questions such as: Why were the Israelites unable to completely clear the land of their enemies? Why did God not want them to have a king for the first 400 years of their settlement in Canaan? These and many more are discussed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Section Four describes the kingdom years. It traces the history of the nation, noting the actions of the kings and the work of God&#39;s prophets with them and the people. The nation&#39;s division into two kingdoms (known as Israel and Judah), their spiritual declines, and the work of reformer kings and prophets to bring them back comprise the meat of this section. The book closes with a discussion of the captivity, the restoration, and the silent years between the Old and New Testaments. It leaves the reader, as the O.T. was intended to do, with the expectation of and preparation for the coming of the Messiah. Charts, Maps, illustrations, and a lively and insightful style make this book an excellent resource for individual and small group study.&lt;/P&gt;" />
