  <title>The Eucharist and World Hunger - Izunna Okonkwo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hunger is a menace in different parts of the globe. It has more unnatural than natural causes. Though efforts have been made towards alleviating its causes and consequences, more actions still need to be taken for its genuine alleviation and eventual eradication in the world. For Joseph Grassi, painful hunger is a daily occurrence that must be countered by ongoing effective programs that enter into the lives of every Christian. Such position not only recognises the frequency and excruciating nature of hunger but also suggests that Christians and other religious groups have a very important role to play in order to eradicate hunger and its devastating effects. This book explores the nuances of hunger, its causes, dimensions and approaches, as well as its connection to the Eucharist. It argues that hunger can be eradicated and that the Eucharist stands out as a veritable model." />
