  <title>Enemy Territory - Douglas Mosley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The battle rages in enemy territory   are you prepared for victory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As an ordained minister and former Marine Sergeant, I hope to bring you insight into the battle we face against an enemy that walks among us every day. This enemy is not of any foreign power; it is not even of this world. The enemy we face attacks us spiritually. We must be prepared to fight him spiritually just as much as any physical army is prepared to fight its enemy physically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We must be equipped, trained and prepared for serious spiritual warfare to win this battle. The enemy comes at us from all angles, with all forms of attack. Millions of souls hang in the balance where so few people are even aware of his presence in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Through these pages, I endeavor to enlighten you with an understanding of the various weapons and tactics of the enemy we face in spiritual battle. Armed with the Word of God, I will show you how to engage the enemy in his territory and defeat in him once and for all. And not just in your personal life, but in the ongoing quest to bring souls to the Kingdom and bring Glory to God!&lt;/p&gt;" />
