  <title>Biography of the Biblical God - E. Asamoah-Yaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Biography of the Biblical God is an insightful and thought-provoking analysis of religion and faith. In this compelling and stimulating read, one will discover a myriad of well-supported facts and references which question the validity of Biblical claims and explanations. Written by E. Asamoah-Yaw, the provocative pages of this book reveal the Bibles lack of verisimilitude with scientific, as well as the common laws of nature. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A groundbreaking expose on the humanity of Jesus Christ, his intimate marital and sexual relations with Mary Magdalene, historical inconsistencies of the Catholic Church, the inaccuracies of the Book of Genesis explaining the beginning of creation, the holes in the four Gospels of the New Testament and many more are all discussed in this analytical book. This creative and compelling page-turner will no doubt strike intellectuals and insinuate a sense of curiosity within an individual. A book that will surely appeal to those who possess an independent mind and a logical sense of reasoning, A Biography of the Biblical God will stimulate a wide avenue for discussion, serving as a catalyst for ones personal reflection on the things previously assumed and accepted to be true. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Furthermore, this read sends an eye-opening message to its readers. Mr. Asamoah-Yaw explains that faith in anything outside the self is demonstrably not dependable, not predictable and in fact very counter-productive. Religious faith may temporally increase peoples comfort levels, but it freezes the knowledge of the self and therefore prevents humans to face head-on challenges of the practical world. For the author, faith outside the self encourages total self-submission and hinders one from discovering ones innate powers." />
