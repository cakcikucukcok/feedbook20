  <title>The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity - Philip Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this new and substantially expanded Third Edition, Philip Jenkins continues to illuminate the remarkable expansion of Christianity in the global South--in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Drawing upon the extensive new scholarship that has appeared on this topic in recent years, he asks how the new Christianity is likely to affect the poor, among whom it finds its most devoted adherents. How should we interpret the enormous success of prosperity churches across the Global South? Politically, what will be the impact of new Christian movements? Will Christianity contribute to liberating the poor, to give voices to the previously silent, or does it threaten only to bring new kinds of division and conflict? Does Christianity liberate women, or introduce new scriptural bases for subjection?  Acclaim for previous editions of The Next Christendom:  Named one of the Top Religion Books of 2002 by USA Today  Named One of the Top Ten Religion Books of the Year by Booklist (2002)  Winner of the Christianity Today Book Award in the category of Christianity and Culture (2002)  Jenkins is to be commended for reminding us, throughout the often gripping pages of this lively work...that the history of Christianity is the history of innovative--and unpredictable--adaptations. --The New York Times Book Review  This is a landmark book.  Jenkins thesis is comprehensively researched; his analysis is full of insight; and his projection of the future may indeed prove to be prophetic. --Baptist Times  A valuable and provocative look at the phenomenon widely ignored in the affluent North but likely to be of enormous importance in the century ahead.... The Next Christendom is chillingly realistic about the relationship between Christianity and Islam. --Russell Shaw, Crisis  If the times demand nothing less than a major rethinking of contemporary global history from a Christian perspective, The Next Christendom will be one of the significant landmarks pointing the way. --Mark Noll, Books &amp;amp; Culture" />
