  <title>&quot;Sex Camp&quot; - Brian McNaught</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty-two strangers arrive at a Church-owned retreat facility on Saturday to work with some of the best trainers in the field of sexuality. Theyre told that by the end of the week, theyll know more about sex than ninety percent of the population. What they go home with on the following Saturday is a lot more than they anticipated or were promised.
Besides laughing, crying, swearing, and cheering through films and intimate discussions about sexual values, body image, self-pleasuring, gender identity, sexual orientation, seduction, abuse, theology, and turn ons, they faced off with each other around an altar in the woods, under blankets and star-filled skies, bare-assed in the water, and with hands joined singing in a circle.
Most everyone goes home forever changed. That is, if they make it through the week.
The Annual Workshop on Sexuality at Thornfield was called the worlds best kept secret. Now youre in on it." />
