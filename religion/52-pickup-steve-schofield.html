  <title>52 Pickup - Steve Schofield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 10:32 Jesus states, &quot;Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven.&quot; (NASB). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;52 pickup:These are the words I give to you to share with everyone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; contains my testimony, how the book came about and a collection of 52 God inspired poems. The 52 poems are based on everyday events in my life since accepting Christ as my savior in August 2007. The poems cover such topics as Anger, Temptation, and Bitterness to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target audience for 52 Pickup is anyone looking for devotionals to use in a small group, as ministry and sermon ideas, or just be inspired by Gods words. Every story is inspired by God; I was just the person who typed the words. I would read or see some key words, and then all of a sudden I would be writing a story. After the story was done, I would read it and know that God had inspired it. There has been little altering or proofreading. Ive included with each poem, scripture to reference, and a Story Behind the Poem. These are brief snippets I captured at the time trying to explain the situation that inspired the writing. Some are more in-depth than others, but meant to communicate was happening at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also showed me God has a sense of humor. I always wanted to own an old truck, when he revealed the details including name of the book, I laughed! I got my 52 pickup truck, it was not what I expected. It is my hope the poems in 52 pickup will inspire you as much as they have me!&lt;/p&gt;
