  <title>Salvation with Love, Jesus - Joy D. Siano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this uncertain time there is One you may depend on for now and eternity. He is the same yesterday, today and forever - stable and dependable in every way. Prayerfully, this book will introduce you to Him. Jesus Christ is alive and loves you.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call upon Him while He is near. &lt;/i&gt;- Isaiah 55:6 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is a special revelation for backsliders in this book. I urge you to read it and let the Holy Spirit revive you and your personal relationship with Jesus, our Loving Savior. He did not come to give us religion; He came to give us life, which is in Him. He came so that we should know Him personally and know how much He loves us. Receive His grace to walk in victory by faith and the power of His Holy Spirit. &lt;br&gt;
I know there are people out there who once walked with Jesus as out of the Book of Acts and you yearned for everyone to know Jesus. If you have ever been disappointed by people, misguided by religion, overwhelmed by condemnation - dont give up. You were under law, not grace. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. &lt;/i&gt;- John 1:17 KJV&lt;br&gt;
Give the real Jesus a chance. He is the One - and there is only one - Who truly loves you unconditionally: the Jesus you met at your salvation. Just to truly know Jesus is the abundant life, and you know and remember, by the Holy Spirit. Trust Him again, forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Him,  br&gt;
Joy D. Siano&lt;/p&gt;" />
