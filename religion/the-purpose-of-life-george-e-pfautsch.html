  <title>The Purpose of Life - George E Pfautsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a youth, my parents, pastor and teacher taught me that our purpose in life was to know, love and serve God. I was also taught that by fulfilling our purpose in life we would be taking the right path to Heaven.It is my unwavering belief thatthese are the most important lessons of life. Our acceptance of these teachings and our faith in Godare enshrouded in mystery. Why and how each of us accepts our faith in God varies. Therefore, there are numerous personal experiences and beliefs included in this book. If we properly fulfill our purpose in life, we willlove our neighbor as ourself. If we love God and love our neighbor as we are directed to do by our Creator, life on earth would more closely parallel life in Heaven. Our purpose in life includes the never-ending attempts to do His will on earth as it is done in Heaven. In the world today, religions are faulted for many things, oftenunjustly. But there can be no faulting our faith in God.Faith is agift that every individual is free to accept or reject." />
