  <title>Siree Guru Granth Sahib (Sikh Religion Scriptures 1) - Swarn Singh Bains</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Excerpts from Siree Guru Granth Sahib
God is one. It is true. He is the Creator. He has no concern with anything. He has no enemy. He is immortal. He does not take birth. He came into existence on His own. He is realized by gurus (divine teacher) grace reciting Gods name.    
                                Recite
Page 9 Be stable like a mountain, patience like a goldsmith. Be humble like an anvil; repeat the name of God like the repetition of a hammer. Intent like bellows and repeat the name of God from within, as fire gives heat.  Make sincerity a pot; mint your mind with the name of God.  That is how divinity is achieved.  Blessed by God is the only one who can do this.  Nanak says, only with Gods grace you can miss God and enjoy the fruit. ||38||  Hymn:  Using air as a culture, life has been created by the reaction of water and earth.  The way, day and night begin and end. Same way the whole creation takes birth and dies.  Good or bad whatever they do are accounted for in Gods court.  Everyone gets the fruit of their deeds, some soon others late.  Whoever worked hard to recite the name of God? Nanak says, they have attained salvation and many more have accompanied them.
Gods worship is not wearing saffron coloured or dirty clothes. O Nanak, God is worshipped sitting at home through true gurus teaching. ||64|| You may wander in all four corners and read four Vedas and all other scriptures in all four ages. O Nanak, if you meet with the true guru, then only God enshrines in the mind and obtains salvation. The guru is God. Worshipping guru the God with devotion attains salvation.
First Master: Songs, sounds, pleasures and clever tricks; Joy, love and the power to command; Wearing clothes and food have no place in the consciousness. True intuitive peace comes by enshrining Gods name in the mind.
Page 60  O mind, love God as the fish loves water. As the water gets deeper she enjoys more; the mind and body become peaceful. It cannot survive without water even for a moment. Water also feels the pain. ||2||   O mind, love the Lord, as the rain bird loves rain. The ponds get filled, the land becomes lush green but the rain bird does not get a drop.   You receive what is in your fate. You only get what you earn. ||3|| O mind, love God as the water loves milk. Water mixed with milk changes its colour but does not let the milk change.
Page 262  Hymn: Guru is mother, the father, the master and transcendent Lord. Guru is a friend the destroyer of ignorance, a relative and a brother. Guru is the bestowal, the teacher of Gods name. Gurus lesson is distinct. Guru is the image of peace truth and intellect. Guru is the touchstone that transforms. Guru is a shrine, pool of nectar. To obtain gurus divine knowledge is beyond imagination.  Guru is the Creator, the destroyer of sins; Guru purifies the sinners.  Guru exists from the beginning, for a long time, for ages. Reciting God through gurus teaching attains salvation.  O God; unite me with the guru by your grace; that I the sinner swim across holding on to guru the true guru the God the transcendent Lord the guru; Nanak prays and pays his regard to guru the God. ||1|| 
||56|| Once you obtain divine treasure, do not tell anyone O kabeer; There is no market, no appraiser, no customer, and no price ||23||
O Kabeer; take your drum and beat it for ten days. Life is like people meeting on a boat on a river; they shall not meet again. ||80|| Be a pebble stone lying on the road by giving up ego. Such a humble slave shall meet the Lord. ||146|| What good is the pebble; which gives pain to the walking. O Lord, Your servant should be like dirt on the earth. ||147|| What good is the dust, which blows and sticks to the body. Gods servant should be such, as water in water. ||148|| What good is water which becomes cold and hot. Gods servant should just like God: ||149|| O Kabeer; it is good to serve both; one the saint the other the God. God is the bestowal of liberation; the s" />
