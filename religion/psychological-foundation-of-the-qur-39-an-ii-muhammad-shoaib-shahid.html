  <title>Psychological Foundation of the Qur&#39;an Ii - Muhammad Shoaib Shahid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My goal is to introduce logical and scientific results and analysis of the observation of the deteriorated state of the Muslim Ummah, which has been dependant over semi-educated, non-Arabic speaking Imams/Mullahs presenting Islam with personal agendas and misinterpretation of the Qur&#39;an due to a foreign language or lack of insight to find solutions to all human issues presented by the Creator for His beloved creature. 
My sole reference in all the presentation is only the Qur&#39;an to unite the Muslims who have split into various sectarian, political and social divisions through issues like terrorism, Bidaha, misconceptions over human and women&#39;s rights, and power struggles, under one umbrella of the Ummah based on One God, one Last Prophet (Muhammad PBUH) with one Holy Book (the Qur&#39;an) for guidance in individual affairs and social justification. Outdated preaching practices (with projection of fear of punishment), mishandling of adolescent anxieties and concerns, intolerant attitudes, and indulging in rituals instead of religious obligations have confused the laypersons and those ignorant of Islam about the original Islmaic intention presented in the Qur&#39;an.
I have presented the data for all English-speaking populations settled globally, with logic and observation on scientific tools, at the layperson&#39;s mental level to answer the misunderstandings or objection about Islam and the Qur&#39;an. This present publication is a solution to meet this noble mission of Allah for preaching His message to the derailed population, particularly among the Muslims." />
