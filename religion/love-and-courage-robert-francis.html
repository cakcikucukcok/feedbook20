  <title>Love and Courage - Robert Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While I was doing my writing for this book. Suddenly it came to me, realizing why love; as the power to withstand any circumstances; and became victorious. If you think about it for real, there are icons in every form of status; or with whom of great faculties, on this planet earth cannot touch love. Or even to say, mess it up, soil it up or to have love corrupt! Or even to change the character of what love represent. Love stand alone in the uniqueness of its power and purity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But always there for anyone to feel its energy; or I should say his energy, in any given situation! God is love, keep in mind; and the passion of love have no puff up pride of his character! Love inspired forgiveness to set us free. Uniquely; this is what this book is talking about, love, forgiveness, courage and loyalty towards the journey of life! With all the circumstances in life, love take you on his shoulders; and carve you out like a shining star. There are no situations that are too hard for courage, forgiveness and loyalty! And its all coming from the power of love. This book through the spirit of the Almighty God, will reset your perspectives through life journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say this for sure, that many of us is taking on too much responsibilities; without inviting God Almighty on their sides! They didnt consulted with the Most Holy and Wise One; and we end up pay the price of regrets! {Proverbs: 10:1}, said a wise son makes a glad Father, but a foolish son is a grief to his Mother. Love is an inspiration to the human heart. Never-the-less we only can follow the foot prints of love, to have love; hes the door keeper and comforter! Love have the voice to be heard over the highest mountain, and down in the deepest valley. Love can melt the heart of stone, and brings back positive; when the darkness of negative covers the soul! We all needs the character of love, the glory of love; and the power of love to our guide and friend. When the heart of men recognize love, there is a spiritual light shines on us where we are free; to see more of his glory and power. The presence of God the creator, is the presence of love who is the reviver of our soul; when we are spiritual dead love give us back life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
