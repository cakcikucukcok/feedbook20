  <title>The Harley Chronicles - Sarah Huxford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Harley Chronicles emerged from the premise that all marriages need attention and careeven great marriages. It is written with the hope that women of all ages will take seriously what God intends and stop being distracted by cultural views of marriage. Each chapter is a different motorcycle trip experienced from the backseat of a Harley. The mixture of stories and lessons from the Word of God makes this a unique and fun ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covering issues from communication to commitment, The Harley Chronicles seeks to give couples the language to talk about topics that need to be addressed before marriages hit the crisis stage.  This Bible Study is designed to be used either alone or with ones spouse or in a small group of friends. To get the most benefit, however, this study should be taken a step further by gathering a group of peers for discussions weekly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All marriages need hope and joy, and this book seeks to serve up big doses of both. The overriding theme of keeping laughter alive in your marriage may just be the best medicine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
