      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Marne Marriner left Point Harbor in the Outer Banks of North Carolina when she wasa child of ten years old. It broke her heart to leave the only home she had ever known for a strange place called Hawaii; but go she must for her parents&#39; work was taking them to that lush tropical paradise. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Marne grows up learning to accept what she cannot change. She becomes interested in photography and learns to freelance from her father who is the best in his field, and goes on to become a well known freelancer. However, she comes to a turning point in her life when her parents are killed tragically in a caraccident, but finds strength andlearns to go on through the faith taught her by her mother. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Marne is finally moving on with her life when she receives the letter, and learns that she is destined to walk the windswept Outer Banks once again, where wild mustangs roam free. She finds she has inherited the tall old house in Point Harbor, the place she loved so muchas a child, but finds thatthings have changed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With no one to welcome her except her aunt&#39;s attorney, who isn&#39;t anxious tomake her acquaintance, and a housekeeper with hostility in the depths of herguarded eyes, Marne is unprepared for the dark secrets she has come home to. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Leaving behind a young man who secretly cares, and puts his life on hold for her, Marne finds comfort in a stranger,a man from Manteo; a man without a past, whose kindness sees her through a time of great despair such as she has never known. She ultimately finds that faith sees her through once again, and that love heals all wounds, no matter how deep.&lt;/P&gt;" />
