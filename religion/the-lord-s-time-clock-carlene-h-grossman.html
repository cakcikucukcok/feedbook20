  <title>The Lord’S Time Clock - Carlene H. Grossman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author, Carlene, is inspired to write of a vacation when her husband, George, a Southern California Rotary Club president, is to become a president of his district. Georges Rotary training allows his wife, Carlene, to see her favorite ninety-year-old aunt Jean, who lives in Oregon. Their friendship with Aunt Jean was lost. The couple loves her and must contact her. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aunt Jean suffers a heart attack before their trip to Portland, Oregon, starts. Carlenes dream comes nightly that her aunt Jean faces danger, even death. Carlene and Aunt Jean can talk in her dream, and Carlene can feel her aunts emotions and pain. The aunt begs Carlene, Come see me in each dream. Aunt Jean prays for the Lord to do his will. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unusual happenings occur during Georges training. Carlene has new dreams. George is angry when Carlene tells him they should visit her aunt based on her dreams information. She has promised Aunt Jean to search for her. Worried, Carlene asks Pat to explain that her dreams come in bits and pieces. George discourages Carlene as he states, Who listens to dreams in this age and time? You are a college graduate, and I cannot believe you want to do this! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The training is over and no one knows what has happened to Aunt Jean, yet Carlene insists she will be found. Aunt Jeans personal phone number is theirs. Does that work? It works, but Aunt Jean says she lives in a yellow house. Again, George is upset. Without an address or city, he searches on a mystical trip, and the couple gets lost. Prayer alerts Pam, an angel, to appear. Be inspired, and enjoy the love of the Lord. Read The Lords Time Clock.&lt;/p&gt;" />
