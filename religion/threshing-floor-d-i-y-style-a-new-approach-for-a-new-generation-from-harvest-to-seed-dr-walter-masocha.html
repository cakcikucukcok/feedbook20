  <title>Threshing Floor D.I.Y Style: a New Approach for a New Generation; from Harvest to Seed - Dr Walter Masocha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible suggests that unbelievers are a crop ready for harvest. When harvested, they are taken to the threshing floor, where husks and chaff are removed to reveal the precious seed (Matt. 3:11-12; 9:35-38).
This book develops the concept of Threshing floor by simple reference to a typical sub-urban town-house or mansion with nine floors, each of them being a Threshing Floor. 
For various reasons, many Christians are uncomfortable to approach someone else for counselling. Fatally wounded by fellow Christians, whether leaders or not, they quietly withdraw from the Church. Alternatively, they stay put, but deeply wounded and hurt, they limp along and remain in the Church. They become religious. 
This book offers a new, innovative, D.I.Y approach to Christian Counselling, whereby one approaches others only in the event of failure of the D.I.Y. process. Touching on various character and behavioural attributes, the Bible is explored to clinically analyse scriptures, offering chances for the wounded and those who wound others to get self-threshed by the Word of God on different theoretical floors in the House God (Psalm 23:6).
When fully threshed, they serve in Gods house with a sweet spirit, agape love, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." />
