  <title>Ashamed of the Gospel (3rd Edition) - John MacArthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the third edition of this top-selling book, John MacArthur challenges the seeker-sensitive, user-friendly, entertainment-oriented pragmatism that permeates the church today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the late 1800s, Charles Spurgeon warned that the church was drifting away from the purity of the gospel, candy-coating God&#39;s Word rather than boldly proclaiming the truths of Scripture. As a result, Christianity&#39;s influence in nineteenth-century England was severely weakened. One hundred years later, John MacArthur, troubled by the seeker-sensitive movement and an emphasis on pragmatism within the church, sounded the same alarm with the first edition of &lt;em&gt;Ashamed of the Gospel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this newly revised and expanded edition, MacArthur gives an overview of developments in the seeker-sensitive movement since his book was first published in 1993. New material traces the line of pragmatic philosophy from the seeker-sensitive movement through the Emergent phenomenon, explaining why the latter is a philosophical heir of the former-and an even greater danger; chronicles the failure of pragmatic approaches to church growth; and emphasizes the importance of evangelicals solidly committed to biblical doctrine rising to positions of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
