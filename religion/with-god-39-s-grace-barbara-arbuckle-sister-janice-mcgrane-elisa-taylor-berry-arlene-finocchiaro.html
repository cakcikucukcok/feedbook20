  <title>With God&#39;s Grace... - Barbara Arbuckle, Sister Janice McGrane, Elisa Taylor Berry, Arlene Finocchiaro...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With Gods Grace ... takes you into the lives of five women seeking the meaning of grace. Do you know what grace feels like? Is it real? How do you get it? Do you have to earn it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting as strangers, their stories became entwined weaving themes of childlike trust, healing and forgiveness. They bring you along in their soul-searching experiences to discover grace is real and how much God loves you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;His gift is not one-size-fits-all but is specifically designed for the person receiving it. Through their trials, God reaches out with different paths of grace. In their cries for help, they dont always get what they ask for. But with overwhelming challenges God showers overwhelming grace.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Along the way they offer reflections to explore grace in your own life. Once you start understanding how to look and ask for it, you will be astounded by Gods gift.&lt;/p&gt;" />
