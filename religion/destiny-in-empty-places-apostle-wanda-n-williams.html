  <title>Destiny in Empty Places - Apostle Wanda N. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For I know the plans that I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope, and a future. Then you will call upon me, and I will listen to you, you will seek me, with all your heart. (Jeremiah 29:1113)
Destiny in Empty Places is a book that is a result of every man and womans journey, a journey many lives follow every day, going through life just merely existing. The average life is lived trying to seek out and fulfill a purpose, looking for meaning and seeking an understanding of the broken pieces in their lives. The average life in humanity is also void for years and years without a single purpose. One never knows where his or her absolute destiny lies. We spend a lifetime fulfilling either our parents dreams or that which we think we should be. We have even convinced ourselves that our chosen purpose is clearly what we were created to be. If one would go beyond their past and look beyond their natural essence, back to their spiritual essence, one would then find purpose for his or her own life.
This book, Destiny in Empty Places, challenges every traveler on the road of destiny. Your road to destiny is predetermined but not by you who travels it. This simply means that God has given you a destiny that is predetermined. Whether or not you will travel or find that road of destiny will be up to your wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of God, of who he is, and your purpose in destiny.
According to statistical research, there are approximately 6,670,985,957 people in the world  who live their lives from day to day without purpose, plan, or form. Purpose is the intent that is set up for us as an object or an end to attain; the intention at the end; a resolution, determination, the action in course of execution.  
People have arrived at a place in life where it looks like they are not accomplishing anything.  Their lives are spent as if they are traveling in a circle. People are seeking out randomly, striving to fill the void in their lives, leaving them discouraged and vacillated into an empty place. This emptiness is only on the surface of the face of the deep.
At your choice lies your destiny." />
