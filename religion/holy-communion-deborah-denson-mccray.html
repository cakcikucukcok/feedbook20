  <title>Holy Communion - DeBorah Denson McCray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you know that there is another way to be healed that is not practiced and for the most part neglected by the body of Christ but was revealed to Paul? Read about this in Holy CommunionThe Blessing That Heals. You will come to understand that partaking of the Holy Communion is not a ritual but a glorious gift of grace for our well-being. You will discover how to take advantage of this glorious gift of grace as often as you like, how to discern biblically the Lords body and blood, and how to approach the Communion table. You will discover that if you have been examining yourself before partaking, you were examining the wrong thing. Discover the double cure and how the power of proclaiming the Lords death can build your faith and defeat the enemy in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehovah-Rophe is our healing. He provided many ways for us to enjoy health and wholeness. If you approach this book prayerfully and with an opened heart to understand the most neglected and least-practiced way to receive from Jesus, you wont be disappointed. It is your new covenant right.&lt;/p&gt;" />
