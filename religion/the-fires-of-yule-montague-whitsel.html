  <title>The Fires of Yule - Montague Whitsel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the myth and folklore of ancient European cultures and spiritual traditions, the longest night of the year, called Winter Solstice, was a time of transition during which people sought out personal renewal and rebirth. The Fires of Yule provides a template and a pattern for entering deeply into the Winter Solstice Season, experiencing it in poetic and transformative ways through a contemporary calendar called The Thirteen Dayes of Yule.
Readers of The Fires of Yule will follow a pilgrim path of the Thirteen Dayes from 13 to 25 December, engaging in various myths, symbols, stories, and rituals associated with each day. Becoming practitioners of the Yule, deepening their experience of the Winter Solstice, they will move beyond the more banal and commercialized forms of the December holidays. 
The calendar of the Thirteen Dayes is sourced (historically) in Celtic myth and Paganism, as well as (imaginatively) in the lore of the Elves of ancient pre-Celtic worlds. This book brings together many of the best-known icons and customs of modern Christmas traditions, re-sourcing them in the light of a Pagan Hearth and offering touchstones for self-renewal at Winter Solstice. 
This revised edition of The Fires of Yule presents the mystic pattern of Thirteen Dayes in its fullest expression, narrated in the voice of a fictional character, Cornelius Whitsel, a student of religion and a Pagan spiritual director in the Keltelven Traditions who lives in the imagined landscape of Ross County, Pennsylvania. Cornelius has been a character in two of Montague Whitsels other books; Ham Farir: The Faring of Matthew Thorin Dier (2008) and Tales from the Seasons (2009). 
The Fires of Yule is the culmination of more than three decades of the authors devout engagement with the Yule and deep reflection on the nature of the Winter Solstice. Montague Whitsel has explored, studied and practiced Western spiritualities grounded in the Celtic, Neo-Pagan and Monastic traditions for more than 40 years." />
