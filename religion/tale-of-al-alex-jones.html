  <title>Tale of Al - Alex Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fredrick Johnson has one foot in hell and one foot in heaven. With his faith hanging in the balance, he is torn between two worlds determined to claim him for themselves. But the Devil has a plan. She has chosen a soul mate for Freddy to partner with on Earth. As she snaps her fingers, the floor gives away beneath Freddy and he plunges toward the pale blue sky of a new beginningwhether he likes it or not.
Al Locke is a pessimistic alcoholic who has to commit a selfless act of good to save himself and the fate of Freddy, whose soul is in limbo. But first he must put aside his narcissism, his materialistic lifestyle, and resist the evil temptations of his manipulative wife, Andrea. Unfortunately, Al is consumed with greed and wealth, which the Devil uses to her advantage by offering him all the worldly possessions he desires under one condition: he must shun an eternal life in heaven to have an opportunity to be crowned a prince in her kingdom. As he ponders his possibilities, Al has no idea of what awaits him and Freddy.
Tale of Al is the tale of one mans struggle with temptation as he is led down a path lined with pitfalls amid an epic battle between God and the Devil." />
