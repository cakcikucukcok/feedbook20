  <title>Wisdom of the Soul and Life&#39;s Challenges - Halim Ozkaptan, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The relationship between the soul, consciousness and spirituality is presented. The soul is a part of God that he has bestowed upon us. It is our moral source. It represents our love and positive emotions that contribute to our moral value and growth. Consciousness is our creative and life force that derives from the soul. It is the spark of life that creates and sustains us. Our spirituality reflects the quality of our soul that is expressed through our conscious behavior. It is the intermediary between the soul and consciousness. We are spiritual beings living a mortal life and are reflections of God&#39;s love and spirit. Free will and choice are our burden. We are challenged to avoid less than honorable deeds. Our behavior, actions and treatment of others become the essence of our character. We are also spiritually interconnected. We attract like spirits throughout our lives for support, personal growth or loss. Our life represents the wisdom of our soul." />
