  <title>Remembering the Future: A Collection of Essays, Interviews, and Poetry at the Intersection of Theology and Culture: The Other Journal 2004-2007 - Chris Keller, Andrew  David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Remembering the Future is a collection of poems, essays, and interviews that ask readers to see their world with double-vision-to imagine the redemptive consequences of engaging the world with a fastidious awareness of both the biblical tradition and the cultural moment. Remembering the Future is gathered from the first years of The Other Journal, an online quarterly positioned at the intersection of theology and culture. The Other Journal examines theology with fresh eyes, probing faith with passion, authenticity, and creativity; and this anthology represents the highlights of that endeavor, including content from some of the most important voices in the field of theology today. Remembering the Future offers readers an engaging, thought-provoking picture of what sound theological thinking can and must offer today&#39;s Christians giving witness to Christ in our contemporary cultural landscape." />
