  <title>God, Not God - Earnest Lee Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Picking up a Bible and reading it can be difficult, for many reasons. It is time-consuming, long, and can be somewhat boring. It has been easier for many of us to simply let someone else explain or tell us of the Bible. Yet by doing so, we are acquiring that persons opinions and beliefs. We are not forming our own opinions if we have not read the book for ourselves.  
We may hear great and wonderful things concerning what the Bible says from one person, and terrible and fearful things from another. This makes one wonder if there were two different Gods in the Bible, as they can be described so differently. The authors book is not meant to change or form beliefs, but to give readers information from the Bible that they may not have heard before. It is his hope that his writing will cause readers to want to begin to read the Bible for themselves to find out exactly what it says. 
Just as the Bible is simple in its words, this book has been written in its simplest form so that readers may understand every point being made. Is the God of the Bible the real God? Could God be totally different than the God of the Bible? Have our minds been programmed to follow what we are told? Was the Bible that you read or that you were told about even meant for you? We should not be afraid to research such topics and form our own opinions. We should know that it is both okay to believe, but it is also okay to ask questions." />
