  <title>Bewildered Travel: The Sacred Quest for Confusion - Frederick J. Ruf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do we travel? Ostensibly an act of leisure, travel finds us thrusting     ourselves into jets flying miles above the earth, only to endure dislocations of time and space,     foods and languages foreign to our body and mind, and encounters with strangers on whom we must     suddenly depend. Travel is not merely a break from routine; it is its antithesis, a voluntary     trading in of the security one feels at home for unpredictability and confusion. In     &lt;i&gt;Bewildered Travel&lt;/i&gt; Frederick Ruf argues that this confusion, which we might     think of simply as a necessary evil, is in fact the very thing we are seeking when we leave     home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruf relates this quest for confusion to our religious behavior. Citing     William James, who defined the religious as what enables us to &quot;front life,&quot; Ruf contends     that the search for bewilderment allows us to point our craft into the wind and sail headlong     into the storm rather than flee from it. This view challenges the Eliadean tradition that     stresses religious ritual as a shield against the world&#39;s chaos. Ruf sees our departures     from the familiar as a crucial component in a spiritual life, reminding us of the central role     of pilgrimage in religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to his own revealing experiences as a     traveler, Ruf presents the reader with the journeys of a large and diverse assortment of notable     Americans, including Henry Miller, Paul Bowles, Mark Twain, Mary Oliver, and Walt Whitman. These     accounts take us from the Middle East to the Philippines, India to Nicaragua, Mexico to     Morocco--and, in one threatening instance, simply to the edge of the author&#39;s own     neighborhood. &quot;What gives value to travel is fear,&quot; wrote Camus. This book illustrates the truth     of that statement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
