  <title>Freedom of the Will - Jonathan Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Christian evangelical preacher during the early 1700&#39;s, during the First Great Awakening, Jonathan Edwards is considered one of America&#39;s most important and original philosophical theologians. His polemic work &quot;Freedom of the Will&quot; refutes the notion that humans have complete free will over the choices they make. Instead, Edwards claims that will is driven by human desire. In Edwards&#39; beliefs, people are sinners at heart. They do not naturally follow God&#39;s wish for their future. However, the preacher says that there is a way for humans to &quot;regain&quot; their will; they must wholly believe in God&#39;s path for them. Understanding God&#39;s plans and accepting them allows someone to choose their own way. They can make a conscious effort to choose the best path for their life. Edwards took his beliefs to heart and followed what he thought was God&#39;s plan for his own life and in so doing helped to start a religious revival in America. He also is credited with starting the New Light Calvinist movement, which was comprised of a group of his closest followers and ministers. To this day his work continues to be admired and commemorated by countless churches, colleges, writers, and theologians." />
