  <title>A Christmas in Princeton - Karen M. Caes, Charles J. Caes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Christmas in Princeton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Christmas in Princeton&lt;/i&gt;, is about holly, carols, and joy, but it also celebrates the very reasons for Christmas and its colorful traditions. It is a touching tale of friendship and inspiration, and the mysterious way in which giving can transform the giver. It is a breezy, little tale  about the meaning and history of Christmas, and it is full of unexpected thoughtfulness and wisdom for young and old.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tom Cooper is a young lad obsessed with getting whatever he wants. Not only is he self-centered in all his pursuits but he never reflects on the magic inherent in the world around him. That is, until one very special holiday season when a twist of fate brings him to the door of a rickety old shack. It serves as the home of a reclusive old gent who lives the most spartan existence. A friendship develops, and one that brings about a deep and lasting change in Tom. But Tom never fully understands what has happened to him until many years pass and the shack and its habitant are long gone.&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Though this story was inspired by an old gentleman whose church provided him with a humble dwelling for his remaining years, the names of individuals and places have been changed, and unconnected events have been intertwined to weave the story.&lt;P&gt;" />
