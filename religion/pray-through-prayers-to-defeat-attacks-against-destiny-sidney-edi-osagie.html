  <title>Pray-Through Prayers to Defeat Attacks Against Destiny - Sidney Edi-Osagie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pray-Through Prayers to Defeat Attacks Against Destiny is a combination of detailed and powerful prayers for most of lifes situations and attacks. The compilation of these prayers is based on the inspiration and leading of the Spirit of God, and these prayers have been proven and tested with positive results and life-changing testimonies. The Holy Spirit knows the immediate and future needs and challenges of man, so He is best suited to instruct and guide us in our approach to prayer (Romans 8:2628). The principle of prayer draws from the practice of communicating with God on the basis of His Word. Therefore, except it is grounded in scripture, there is no other foundation for the prayer communion to be fully potent and effective. As such, each subtitle in this book, after the initial definitions, is tied to scriptural references to further enlighten the reader on the biblical basis for the prayers in question." />
