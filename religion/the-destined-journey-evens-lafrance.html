  <title>The Destined Journey - Evens LaFrance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The group arrived in the City of Shalom a few days later with hunger, exhaustion, and seasickness. It was night, and they went to their homes to rest. The next morning, they walked along the city to give testimonies of what God has done for them on the journey they came from. The people were ignoring them, and they saw the corruption, spiritual sickness, and sinful desires in the people. Gallob, Leeyob, Dolly, and Joseph called Justin, the leader of the church committee, for an urgent meeting to save the city from self-destruction. The people in the city decided to please themselves and started listening to the desires of their flesh and not be sanctified and righteous in the presence of God. Many people became anxious and had evil thoughts and were tempted to commit much sin. The people in the city who became self-centered and prideful decided to separate themselves from the good and humble ones that were obedient and at peace with others. They continued their ministry and began to pray for the sake of those who are lost and are fulfilling the lust of the flesh. Some lost interest in doing Gods work and became evil minded and were possessed with demonic spirits and darkness. A riot started, and people were out of control and became violent. They destroyed houses, beat the weak and old. They took people out into the woods and burned them to death. One child died from a stampede of a group of people and their riot due to her physical handicap and was thrown into a nearby fire. Jonathan and the other church leaders tried to control the people, but some of them threatened to burn down the church and forced the church leaders to leave the city. The leaders gathered together, closed the gates that surrounded the church and the court yard. The church decided to fast for seven days and prayed in the spirit, or spoke in tongues. On the seventh day of the fast and prayer, the church opened the gates, and a few people ran into the courtyard of the church with fear, hopelessness, weariness, and mourning in pain and misery. The corrupted ones returned back to their homes to please themselves, committing adultery and other sexual sins. The other faithful, obedient servants who were left behind in the city hid themselves from the wicked, evil minded, and those that were ungodly. Meanwhile, the leaders came out of the church into the courtyard, and the people that entered were comforted, and encouraged to endure and persevere. Gallob then stepped up and spoke to them.
I want to speak to everyone in the city at 1400 tomorrow. Go and tell them they have a choice to make. Now that they know about the good news and experienced the truth, they will be given a choice to leave or to stay here with us, said Gallob.
What about the children, Gallob? Dolly asked.
Those that are young and not able to listen and understand may leave with their parents who choose to keep them, but those who are mature and at an age to decide for themselves will be given a chance to decide their hearts desire. For whatever comes out of their mouth is whats in their hearts.
Father, our city may soon be destroyed because I forgot to tell you that when we were on our way back home on the ship, I had a dream that a severe storm will pass here and swallow those that corrupted themselves and sin in the presence of God with no fear, said Joseph.
Joseph and the young crew prayed before they stepped out of the courtyard.
That is a revelation of things to come. It may happen sooner than you think, said Gallob.
The following morning, all the leaders of the church went out to the homes of the people and told everyone that a meeting was scheduled in the courtyard of the church at 1400. Leeyana, Galila, and Jonathan also spoke up and wanted to go and save the children who were lost out there. Gallo, Leeyob, Dolly, and Justin gathered together to make a decision if the young adults can go out there alone. The adults decided that Joseph can supervise and help Leeyana," />
