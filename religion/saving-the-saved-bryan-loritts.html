  <title>Saving the Saved - Bryan Loritts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White-knuckling can never get you where you want to go. But grace can&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You already know because you&amp;rsquo;ve tried: repeated attempts to earn God&amp;rsquo;s love and approval get you nowhere and leave you exhausted. When performance taints our relationship with him, the Christian life can turn into an unholy hustle. It was never meant to be like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Saving the Saved&lt;/em&gt;, Pastor Bryan Loritts reveals the astonishing truth that God doesn&amp;rsquo;t want your spiritual scorekeeping. He simply wants your surrender. The punchline of the gospel of Matthew is just that&amp;mdash;a message of grace and performance-free love to do-good, try-harder Jews who thought they had to earn their way into God&amp;rsquo;s favor. It&amp;rsquo;s an ancient message, yet it can be a lifeline to us today as we live in a world of performance metrics. Just as Matthew wrote to the Jews in his gospel, we were never meant to flounder under the pressures and anxieties of show Christianity. Make no mistake: we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; called to live in obedience, but Jesus wants us to save us from the illusion that our actions can ever earn God&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pastor Bryan&amp;rsquo;s relevant, uncompromising style, &lt;em&gt;Saving the Saved &lt;/em&gt;proclaims the good news that once the pressure is off to perform, we are free to abide. Beyond the man-made rules and the red tape, there is a God who knows you by name. Come and meet him as you&amp;rsquo;ve never known him before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
