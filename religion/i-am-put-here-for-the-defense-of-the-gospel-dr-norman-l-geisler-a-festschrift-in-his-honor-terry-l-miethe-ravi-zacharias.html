  <title>I Am Put Here for the Defense of the Gospel: Dr. Norman L. Geisler: A Festschrift in His Honor - Terry L. Miethe, Ravi Zacharias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Norman L. Geisler has been called the &quot;father of evangelical Christian philosophy.&quot; He has written more than one hundred books and taught at universities and top seminaries for some fifty-six years. He was the first president of the Evangelical Philosophical Society and the founder and first president of the International Society of Christian Apologetics. He has spoken or debated in more than two dozen countries and held pastoral/pulpit ministries in four states. Many view him as a cross between Thomas Aquinas and Billy Graham. No one has done more to communicate the modern challenges of the Faith to the &quot;average&quot; Christian, to the church, and to the academy.   This volume offers creative and constructive essays from twenty-three contributors, all notable in their own right, who preserve and propagate Dr. Geisler&#39;s ideas and express appreciation for his influence. Those who know him best say he is &quot;true, faithful, and blessed by God!&quot;" />
