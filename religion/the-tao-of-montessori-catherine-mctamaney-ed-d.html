  <title>The Tao of Montessori - Catherine McTamaney Ed.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&quot;If, like some, you regret that Montessori too rarely in her writings appreciated the humanity of teachers-their creativity, their curiosity, their doubts-this book stands as the perfect complement.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;-Jola-Montessori.com&lt;/P&gt;
Evocative and unique, &lt;I&gt;The Tao of Montessori&lt;/I&gt; offers a quiet balance to the noisy demands of teaching and parenting through a special blend of encouraging verse. Award-winning Montessori teacher Catherine McTamaney revisits the eighty-one verses of Lao-tzu&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/I&gt; and relates them to the life and work of teachers, parents, and children. Originally meant to remind rather than direct and to show the way toward natural harmony in the world around and within us, Lao-tzu&#39;s verses find a new meaning through McTamaney&#39;s skillful mixture of spirituality and education.&lt;/P&gt;
Take a moment to read a single stanza, then put it aside and muse upon its meaning. By revisiting one verse each day, you can relate its images to your life as a teacher, parent, or child. Whether you are familiar with the writings of Lao-tzu or are simply ready to explore a refreshingly contemplative perspective on children and teachers, &lt;I&gt;The Tao of Montessori&lt;/I&gt; is a profound work of intellectual stimulation.&lt;/P&gt;" />
