  <title>Mom…Can You Move My Legs? - Janet L. Givens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The militarys official number of soldiers wounded in Iraq stands at 31,911, although numerous estimates put the real number at over 100,000. With more than 50,000 American troops still stationed in Iraq, its inevitable that the number wounded will continue to grow. In her candid, inspirational new nonfiction, &quot;MomCan You Move My Legs? A soldiers mom recounts the compelling story of her sons injury in Iraq and stresses the importance of knowing Christ in a crisis&quot; (published by WestBow Press), Janet L. Givens shares her personal story of coping with the trauma of war using faith in God and biblical guidance. 
In July 2006, Givens son, Army Sergeant Brad Harris, was wounded in action during Operation Iraqi Freedom. She relates his decision to enlist and the courage and determination he summoned in the wake of Sept. 11, realizing it was his calling to defend his country. It was always her prayer that Brad would return home safely, but on July 22, 2006, both of their lives would be irrevocably changed.
Brad was shot in the lower part of his spinal cord and would spend four months at Hines VA hospital in Chicago in recovery. Upon receiving the news, Givens immediately reached out for help, both from God and her congregation. They were there to comfort and guide her as faith was catapulted into high gear, she recalls. Her church, the Family Christian Center in Munster, Ind., came forth with an outpouring of support, and a group of prayer warriors immediately began praying for Givens and her family. 
Relatable and true-to-life, MomCan You Move My Legs? carries a powerful message that will resonate with readers from all backgrounds. Like you, an array of difficulties has interrupted my life throughout the years, Givens writes. If you are currently in the midst of a seemingly hopeless trial, I pray that the words contained within these pages will plant a seed that will grow into great faith in God. See how faith and prayer can change lives in this uplifting new book." />
