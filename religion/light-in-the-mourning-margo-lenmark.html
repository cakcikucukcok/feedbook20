behind many clear and important messages for the living. Each message is different, and each changed how I live my life. This is what I want to share with you... deathbed revelations about how to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received these messages from the people I was grieving; but their wisdom is for everyone, whether grieving or not. They are stories of the interwoven beauty of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope your journey through my experiences gives you the same gifts I received from them and delivers a fresh perspective on the events in your life. For anyone who has experienced the unbearable sorrow of death, I hope it brings light to your mourning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
