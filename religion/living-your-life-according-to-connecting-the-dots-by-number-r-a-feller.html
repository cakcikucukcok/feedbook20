  <title>Living Your Life According to Connecting the Dots by Number - R.A. Feller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;Faith gives way to praise opening the door to eternity. This allows us to experience the order of life in a time base out of order world. Where there is order there&#39;s an absolute and fellowship with Jesus from His world, the King and giver of life. Things are not always what they appear to be. Are we following projected images on our minds or reality? To find meaning one has to search out answers. &lt;P&gt;
As Joseph stored grain for seven years, God has blessed me by storing up understanding for the times of famine in every day life. &lt;P&gt;
&lt;EM&gt;Living Your Live According to Connecting the Dots by Number&lt;/EM&gt; was written for me to help me understand who I am and what God&#39;s plan is for my life. Writing this book restored sanity to my life by pushing out the dark lies of misperceptions and packing my mind with the light of God&#39;s truth in its place. Jesus navigates, I trust and follow. Now it is my desire to share my vision and help others to grow in His body (Love + Truth = Light), that they may face life&#39;s journey and deal with problems with a close relationship with God to see them through as he does me." />
