  <title>Disciple - Bill Clem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Jesus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a book about pursuit.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;How God pursues people. How we pursue him. And how he uses us to pursue others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;God pursued us when Jesus came into this ruined world as an agent of redemption, asking us to follow him and to become his disciples. Yet, what does Jesus actually mean by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;disciple&lt;/em&gt;? And as his disciples, what is our mission?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pastor Bill Clem masterfully answers these questions, explaining what Jesus meant when he called his followers &amp;ldquo;disciples&amp;rdquo;, and what he intended when he told us to then&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;disciples. This helpful guide weaves together Scripture and real-life stories to illustrate the essential elements of Christian discipleship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve just become a follower of Jesus or you&amp;rsquo;ve been one for years,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Disciple&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will help you see that Jesus invites his people to freedom rather than mere rule keeping, and it will give you a relational framework&amp;mdash;instead of behavioral prescriptions&amp;mdash;for pursuing God.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Disciple - Bill Clem</i></b> | Disciple by Bill Clem has been incredibly thought provoking, challenging and convicting. As strange as it may seem to some, I found the book to also be remarkably uplifting by constantly pointing the reader back to Father, Son and Holy Spirit and using in-context scripture throughout the book.<br /><b><i>Disciple: Getting Your Identity from Jesus: Clem, Bill ...</i></b> | Pastor Bill Clem has been teaching on this subject for years now. I have been very fortunate to sit under his teaching numerous times. At Mars Hill Church we have used this robust definition of being a disciple of Jesus for many years now.<br /><b><i>Disciple: Getting Your Identity from Jesus by Bill Clem</i></b> | “Bill Clem uses his powerful storytelling ability, theological insights, and personal journey to speak straight to the heart of discipleship. Reading this book was like having a cup of coffee with one of the most influential thinkers and ministry leaders of our day.”<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Disciple - Bill Clem</a> </h3></p><hr/>
