  <title>Son of God, Son of Man - Eduardo P. Olaguer Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Son of God, Son of Man is a reflection on the gospels of St. Mark and St. Luke that, like a diptych icon, presents two complementary images of Jesus as the New Joshua and the New Temple. The entire panorama of Israels history after the Exodus, from the entry into the Promised Land to the rebuilding of the Temple after the Babylonian Exile, is thus encapsulated in the life of Christ. This unique work builds on the authors previous commentaries on the gospels of John and Matthew, which portrayed Jesus as the New Genesis and the New Moses.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Second Vatican Council called on Catholics to read the Bible in the same spirit in which it was written. Pope Benedict has led the way into a genuinely post-critical scholarship that respects the many levels of meaning present in the sacred books. Eduardo Olaguer has followed the guidance of tradition and the leadership of the Pope in writing Gospel commentaries that take account of modern scholarship even as they reveal the depths of the divine Word. By connecting each passage of Scripture with others in both Old and New testament, he reads the Bible as the Church Fathers did, seeing the unity that comes from the Spirit working through the human authors and the events they describe. Full of extraordinary insights, this is the commentary that many people have been waiting for.&lt;/P&gt;
