  <title>UNDEFEATED - Elizabeth Meyers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Interacting with a Big God in a messy world can often leave us scratching our heads in confusion. How can we explain the horror of human suffering in light of an all-powerful and perfectly loving God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we bump into pain that that seems unfair and unexplainable and we are shaken to our core. Faith and reality collide and slam hard into one another leaving us broken, confused, and undone by circumstances beyond our control. Our thinking becomes muddied by unanswerable questions and nagging doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s tragedies we hear about in the news, struggles our friends and family face, or our own private pain, life this side of Eternity can really beat up our faith and cause us to wonder if everything God told us and promised us is actually true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our faith rests on unsteady ground, it may falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves us feeling defeated despite our best efforts. We just can&amp;#39;t seem to win no matter what we do. The reason is not really because of the circumstances themselves, but how we respond to them. We live defeated when we are fighting the wrong battles with ineffective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we don&amp;#39;t know the plans of our enemy, the power of our God, and our own true identity, we will never experience lasting victory in this life. If we don&amp;rsquo;t understand the nature of the fight, we will lose every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop working so hard and still feel defeated. Recognize you are in a battle and understand the nature of the war and how to seize your victory. Learn how to identify and fight the right battles with the right weapons so you can win. Know who you are and whose side you&amp;#39;re on. Live victoriously. Stand strong and live UNDEFEATED!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
