  <title>The Interaction Between Law and Love in the Pauline Writings - Pandelani Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are five chapters of this book. The first chapter is the overview of the whole book and how the research was going to be conducted. It also gives the summary of law and love in the books of Paul.
The interaction between law and love in Pauline writing has been an interesting topic, where we have discovered that the law of God cannot be separated from his agape love, which has followed mankind from creation and eventually leads him to eternity. We discovered that the law of God reveals Gods character, and that is his love. The law of God and his love are one and cannot be separated from each other. God gives the law to prove to man that he loves him deeply and eternally.
The death of Jesus on the cross was the final crown of the proof of how much we mean to God and the length He can go to redeem us. He gave his all for our redemption. The plan of salvation is the perfect revelation of law and love in Pauline writings.
Chapter 1 and 2 looks at law and love and the theology and ethics of law and love. The plan of salvation is laid bare and how the Jews missed the mark of spreading the Word to the whole world by holding to God as a Jewish God alone. 
In chapter 3 we discover the difference between the ceremonial law and the Decalogue. The ceremonial laws were pointing toward the coming of Jesus, and so with his arrival, they came to an end because they were pointing to his coming. The Decalogue was there and it will continue till the end of time when Jesus will come the second time. 
Chapter 4 is all about love and what it means to God and how he could not compromise his Decalogue and the meaning of redemption.
Chapter 5 is the blending of law and love in Pauline writings. Keeping the law is not a problem when you love God and you know that God loves you; its not difficult to keep the Decalogue because your love supercedes the law. When you love someone, its easy to follow or keep the law.
Gods Decalogue is a mirror and love is the crown of our redemption. For God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten son to die for man because His law could not be changed. Love will lift us up, such that doing and keeping Gods law will not be a burden but a pleasure because through Christs death, we realize how important we are to God." />
