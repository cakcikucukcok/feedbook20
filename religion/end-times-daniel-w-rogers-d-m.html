  <title>End Times … - Daniel W. Rogers  D.M.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people, both inside and outside of the church, are uncertain on the subject of end times. There are many people inside the church who view end times as unresolved, indeterminable, or totally up in the air. Those outside the church view end times as random, chance, or arbitrary. The schedule of events is established; the only uncertainty is the hour or day they will begin (1 Thess. 5:2).&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both inside and outside of the church, inconclusive views, partial dispositions and false teaching are widespread concerning end times; which promotes uncertainty. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interpreters point to every flood, earthquake or political upheaval as a sign that the final days are fast approaching. While these events may signal the approach of the final days, they are not definitively supported in the Bible. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to study Bible passages within their context. Taking verses out of context leads to error and misunderstanding. To fully understand context, four principles must be considered: literal meaning, historical setting, grammar, and synthesis. Context is crucial to biblical exegesis, in that it is one of its most important fundamentals. 
When you finish reading &lt;i&gt;END TIMES  Five Resurrections and the Rapture&lt;/i&gt;, you will have a clear understanding and a heightened level of confidence about the final days, an understanding you will want to share with others.&lt;p&gt;" />
