  <title>A Hell of Mercy - Tim Farrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;n this unflinching look at depression and the human struggle to find hope in its midst, acclaimed author Tim Farrington writes with heartrending honesty of his lifelong struggle with the condition he calls &quot;a hell of mercy.&quot; With both wry humor and poignancy, he unravels the profound connection between depression and the spiritual path, the infamous dark night of the soul made popular by mystic John of the Cross. While depression can be a heartbreaking time of isolation and lethargy, it can also provide powerful spiritual insights and healing times of surrender. When doctors prescribe medication, patients are often left feeling as if part of their very selves has been numbed in order to become what some might call &quot;normal.&quot; Farrington wrestles with profound questions, such as: When is depression a part of your identity, and when does it hold you back from realizing your potential? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;An Unquiet Mind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Hell of Mercy&lt;/em&gt; is both a much needed companion for those walking this difficult terrain as well as a guide for anyone who has watched a loved one grapple with this inner emotional darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
