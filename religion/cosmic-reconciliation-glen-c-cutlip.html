  <title>Cosmic Reconciliation - Glen C. Cutlip</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Cosmic Reconciliation contains two other volumes: The All-Oneness of God and The Living Christ Consciousness. All three volumes are concerned with the reconciliation of all things through ones Christ Self unto the the God Self of the many within the one. If you can bear to hear now what many could not bear to hear two thousand years ago, you will not want to miss the good news of the reconciliation of all things unto God.&lt;P&gt;	To see the Christ as is, is to come to see God as God is, not what either might appear to be. The reconciliation of all things unto God is the reconciliation of an infinity of many unto the One, for the one and the many are realized to be two parts of the same thing. Now is the time to take responsibility for what you are in God, for now we can see how that an infinity of many share that responsibility with us. And in that sense, the burden is considered to be light (not heavy) burden.&lt;/P&gt;" />
