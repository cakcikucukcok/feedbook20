  <title>Searching for Heroes in Life - Charles Brookins Taylor Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="p&gt;Searching for Heroes in Life takes the recollections of its author, Charles Brookins Taylor Sr., who narrates his lifelong search for heroes, and turns these accounts into an inspiring witness that encourages others to search for the heroes who populate their own lives. Through this combination of reminiscence and guidance, Searching for Heroes in Life shows how one may look at the ordinary people who cross ones path and see in them the special qualities that make them heroic. Searching for Heroes in Life draws upon Abraham Maslows famous Hierarchy of Needsphysiological, security, social, esteem, and self-actualizationas a tool for understanding humanitys deep need for heroes. In particular, he shows how the need for self-actualization includes a need for spiritual self-actualization, which is where real-life heroes may make their special contributions to ones well-being. Then the search for heroes, illustrated with accounts from the authors life, culminates in an exploration of the person and work of Jesus Christ, who is both Hero and Savior of all who believe. In a world that so often seems to grow grey and dim under the weight of trouble and discord, you may find yourself wondering what has become of the good and noble people worthy of respect and admiration. Searching for Heroes in Life will help you to see clearly that heroes who can guide and inspire are living all around you and that Jesus Christ desires to come into your life as the ultimate Hero and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;" />
