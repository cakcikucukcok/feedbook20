  <title>Does Preaching Have a Future? - Dr. Dwight S. Riddick Sr., Dr. Frank A. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From preaching sermons as a child in the backyard, to delivering the upcoming Presidents address for the 101st annual gathering of the prestigious Hampton University Ministers Conference, Dr. Dwight Riddick has become transparent in his book, Does Preaching Have a Future?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you open the pages of this book, you will find insightful, conversational thoughts around the future of preaching. He writes, This book is intended to ignite conversation about what preaching should look like going forward-if this discourse is not already burning in the soul.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This veteran (seasoned) pastor and teacher of the gospel has relied completely upon Scripture in his broad range of topics when it comes to the future of preaching:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;*Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season is a tried and proven counsel for preachers stretching all generations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;*Ezekiel was faced with the question, can these bones live? Preachers today are asked if their preaching can bring about positive transformation in the lives of hopeless people and hopeless cases during changing times.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Riddick supports this conversational topic by reminding his fellow homileticians (preachers) that those called and anointed by God are uniquely qualified to explain the Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
