  <title>The Secret of Healing - Sariputta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reveals the Secret of Healing and shows how one may receive Healing according to The Spiritual Laws of Creation. Healing follows strict principles, which are just like the laws of physics and chemistry. One who desires to be healed must therefore become intimately familiar with these principles. The Law of Karma, for instance, plays a very important part in the healing process. One must attune oneself to this Law in the deepest, humblest manner, if one is to be healed. The author shows the seeker how he or she may thus be attuned, which is nothing other than attunement to The Primordial Light.  In addition, Sariputta explains:  - The power of thought as it pertains to Healing  - The healing power of Elemental Beings  - How crystals can be a source of Healing  - The curative nature of Lemon and Lemon Rind  - Magnetic Healing  - The healing power of language.   This is a book that can be read in a few hours, but will have an impact on one&#39;s entire lifetime!" />
