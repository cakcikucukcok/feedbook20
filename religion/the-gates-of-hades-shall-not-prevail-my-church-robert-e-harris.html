  <title>The Gates of Hades Shall Not Prevail My Church - Robert E. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an unusual book than others because it is spoken in Gods own words. During these times of democracy, crime, war, equal rights, and spiritual abandonment, which seemingly occur every other decade, the world is moving into a chaos of division. There are divisions all over the world, and they are becoming more intense with anger, revenge, radical movements, misunderstanding, and hatred. In this book God is speaking against these detesting spirits that people are accepting in their everyday lives. He then explains how to overcome the chaos that comes from the world and the chaos that overtakes our souls and spirit. God also speaks about that great sin that causes great men in the churches in America, in the synagogues of Israel, and in the Roman Catholic churches all over the world to stumble without them being aware of their sin. God wants to tell the world what causes His anger, and He wants to tell the world what makes Him happy for our benefit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
