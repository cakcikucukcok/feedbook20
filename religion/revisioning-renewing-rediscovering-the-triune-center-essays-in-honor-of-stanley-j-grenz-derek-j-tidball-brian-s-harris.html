  <title>Revisioning, Renewing, Rediscovering the Triune Center: Essays in Honor of Stanley J. Grenz - Derek J. Tidball, Brian S. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An international cast of theologians come together in this volume to offer essays in tribute to the late Stanley J. Grenz, one of the leading theologians of his generation. Accordingly, the volume includes timely explorations in some of the most exciting areas in contemporary theology. It is only fitting that these very explorations revolve around the key motifs of Grenz&#39;s theology (Trinity, community, eschatology) and the key sources from which he drew for theology&#39;s construction (Scripture, tradition, culture). While engaging key features seen in Grenz&#39;s work, some of the essays here interact with Grenz&#39;s own writings, reflecting on his theological journey and his contributions to evangelical theology. In these ways, this volume highlights the kind of evangelical theology that so many have experienced in recent years and of which Stan Grenz was a leading proponent. Revisioning, Renewing, Rediscovering the Triune Center, then, makes a significant contribution to discussions in contemporary theology while itself setting out to honor the life and work of an eminent theologian who did so much for evangelical theology." />
