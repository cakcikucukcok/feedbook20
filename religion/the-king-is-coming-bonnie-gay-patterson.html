  <title>The King Is Coming - Bonnie Gay Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus the Christ is the only person in the history of the world whose life was completely foretold from conception to his death on the cross and resurrection. This book was compiled and illustrated for parents, grandparents and foster parents to teach the children, for Sunday schools, jail mimistries and home Bible studies. It was written for both the believer and seeker.
As Principal of Somerset Christian School, I recommend The King Is Coming by B.G. Patterson. The illustrated book covers over 100 Old Testament Prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus Christ. It is a great resource for children or adults and helps children affirm that Jesus is the Messiah and worthy of worship. 
John Hale, Principal

THE KING IS COMING, written by Bonnie Patterson is a wonderful book that explains how prophecies from Old Testament Biblical references were fulfilled in the New Testament through the Messiah, Jesus. It is done in a simple, yet profound manner for all to understand. I invite all who are seeking truth to read this book and see why true Christians put their faith in Jesus Christ and refuse to renounce Him even in the face of death.

King of Kings Radio Network recommends The King Is Coming by B.G. Patterson. This would be an asset to any Library, a soul winning tool, as well as a great gift to the young Christian or convert making them acutely aware of the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, thereby strengthening their faith! I appreciate Bonnies purpose to help us to be ready always to give a defense to every man that asketh a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear 1 Peter 3:15 
Gwen Carr
Mrs. Patterson has done an excellent job in bringing the Old and New Testament together in giving us a picture of the Son of God. The book THE KING IS COMING will become an excellent resource for study groups in the local church as well as for studying and teaching in the home during devotional times. The books target group seems to be for teenagers and adults, but the beautifully illustrated pictures will appeal to children and can be used by church leaders and parents to draw the attention of children into the study which can be told on their age level. I look forward to many people being reached for Christ as they study this Scriptural presentation of the KING who is coming and whos coming may be very soon.
