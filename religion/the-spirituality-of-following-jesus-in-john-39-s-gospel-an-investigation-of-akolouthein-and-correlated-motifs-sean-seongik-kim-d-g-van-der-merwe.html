  <title>The Spirituality of Following Jesus in John&#39;s Gospel: An Investigation of Akolouthein and Correlated Motifs - Sean Seongik Kim, D. G. van der Merwe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Research on &quot;following Jesus&quot; has mostly been done in terms of what Jesus&#39; followers ought to do. In this unprecedented study, Kim presents &quot;following Jesus&quot; in John&#39;s Gospel through the perspective of what Jesus does for his followers. &quot;Following Jesus&quot; is a journey towards the place where Jesus leads his followers, that is, to a relationship with the Father. It is ultimately participating in the Son&#39;s communion with the Father. Jesus, who was in the bosom of the Father, descended from him and ascends to him, taking his followers with him, so that they may be with him where he is with the Father in glory and love. Kim develops this thesis by examining the term akolouthein (&quot;to follow&quot;) and correlated motifs in John&#39;s Gospel." />
