      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
Most people are pursuing an assumed correct philosophy, right marriage, right religious persuasion, right relationship etc. 
&lt;p&gt;
The pursuit of the identity of Jason revealed these gems: 
&lt;p&gt; The names of the first-born males from Noah to Abraham reveal the most profound prophetic message. The fact that history affirms such is even more remarkable.

This book does not merely reveal the codes, it teaches us how to use them to overcome recurring obstacles; how to sidestep negative people, places and things. Lastly, it reveals an ancient blueprint: our purpose on this planet--according to a very wise, tested and proven &quot;covenant&quot; that Abraham received and what the world has been pursuing secretly and killing for. 
First Sentence:
