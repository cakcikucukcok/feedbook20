  <title>The Crossroads - Brett Heintzman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Weve lost our way, and God is calling us to return to Him. Every church walks a path, comprised of methods, programs, worship styles, etc. The paths our churches travel may have served us well in the past, but they are losing their effectiveness with every passing day. Christian churches in America are facing the challenge of decline, yet many cling to their current paths expecting fresh results of revival and renewal. We are deceived and need direction. God told Israel through the prophet Jeremiah, This is what the LORD says: Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, We will not walk in it (Jeremiah 6:16 NIV). Today, churches are standing at a crossroads. The Crossroads is a critical point of decision that can mean life and fruitfulness or death and extinction, depending on the choices we make today. Will we stay on the unfruitful paths, or will we seek God for the ancient paths of His choosing: Paths of Holy Spirit power and Kingdom purposes? At the crossroads, the choice must be made. The Crossroads points the way to the ancient paths of true Kingdom fruitfulness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
