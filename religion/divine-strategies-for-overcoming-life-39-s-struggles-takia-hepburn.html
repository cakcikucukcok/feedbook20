  <title>Divine Strategies for Overcoming Life&#39;s Struggles - Takia Hepburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is my belief that many people struggle every day. The economic downfall we are facing has crippled many people in the way they provide for their family and meet their basic needs. This is a challenging time and life is throwing hefty blows at many individuals spiritual and physical lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe mankind has tried and failed to eliminate our issues and bring relief to our situation. But I know the only resolution to our problem here on earth is knowing the one and true living God and His son Jesus Christ! It is through getting to know the Holy Spirit and developing a relationship with Him that the hurricanes in our lives will begin to die down. We will experience the grace and mercy of God like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book acts as a practical spiritual guide. It contains simple tips that you can incorporate into your life. I hope these tips will bring reformation to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my sincere prayer that you accept Jesus Christ into your life and meet the Comforter, The Holy Spirit. God bless and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
