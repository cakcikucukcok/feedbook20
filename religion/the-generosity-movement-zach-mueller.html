  <title>The Generosity Movement - Zach Mueller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The wish that we could do more always seems to be a thought that roams around in our minds, leaving us overwhelmed by our humanity and underwhelmed by our generosity. Still God has a way of using our humanity to bring about His plan and reveal what is possible. Truth is, God loves using you and me to share and show His generosity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book looks to help discover and uncover what is possible. It is about seeing the essential pieces and knowing the God given potential that is in each and every one of us when it comes to living and giving. From identifying the frequently misunderstood concepts of generosity and being strategic with how to effectively influence people around you to questions for small groups and personal challenges, this book is not only an educational resource. Gods sole mission has always been to show love and compassion through generosity. A generous God is how we got here and generous living is why we are here. Will you begin a movement of generosity?&lt;/p&gt;" />
