  <title>Spirit Hunger - Gari Meacham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We all have a desperate need for God – not just for following him or being committed to him, but to be intimately connected to him.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We long for purpose, for affirmation, for attention, for nurture. But Gari Meacham writes that we fall short of being desperate for God, or we miss the longed-for romance with God we hear about in scripture.&amp;nbsp; We’re uncertain how to distinguish our longings from our fears.&amp;nbsp; When, says Meacham, did our longings turn to hauntings? And when did we buy into the counterfeit yearnings for control, and the insecurity, perfectionism and other attitudes that quench Spirit Hunger?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The answer to Spirit Hunger is to engage God like never before. In this book Meacham shows through her story and the stories of others how to turn worry into belief, problems and heartaches into a life of intimate prayer, and sighs for intimacy into closeness with God.&amp;nbsp; She discusses her discoveries about prayer including why asking is sometimes hard, how we can notice and track God’s movements as we seek his answers, and why it’s sometimes such a struggle to believe after we’ve prayed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Meacham writes, “With the authenticity of my own life stories—marriage to a professional baseball player, struggles with severe food bondage, and a father who was a quadriplegic—I came to the crisp realization that my prayer life and my belief needed to match. Spirit Hunger provides a clear path towards matching these heart cries—leading away from crumbs and counterfeit, to a hungering for God.”&lt;/P&gt;" />
