  <title>Worth the Cost?: Becoming a Doctor Without Forfeiting Your Soul - Jack Tsai M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This doctor was happily on his way to obtaining the American Dream until he decided to take seriously Jesus&#39; command to &quot;Come, follow me.&quot;  Every year tens of thousands hopeful students apply to medical school. This is the story of one doctor&#39;s medical journey, how he was happily on his way to obtaining the American Dream until he decided to take seriously Jesus&#39; command to &quot;Come, follow me.&quot; Join him as he explores the hidden cost of medical education and Christian discipleship. For those with a burden to serve God in any future vocation, take care you do not get side-tracked by the false promises of this world. What can you do now so that when you are done with your training and ready to do God&#39;s work, you still want to?  From the author: Before you jump on the medical school bandwagon, the four-year, one-hundred-thousand dollar question you should ask is, &quot;Is it all worth it?&quot; Endorsement: &quot;Strategic students know that today&#39;s decisions lead to tomorrow&#39;s reality. When truth is truth it applies in all contexts. While Dr. Tsai emphasizes his lessons learned as a student of medicine, these insights of wisdom apply to all believers who happen to be students.&quot;  - Nick Yphantides, MD; Chief Medical Officer, San Diego County" />
