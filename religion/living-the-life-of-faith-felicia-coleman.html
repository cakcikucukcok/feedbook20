  <title>Living the Life of Faith - Felicia Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living the Life of FAITH is going to take you to a level of faith where trusting in the ability of GOD will be your first response to any situation or circumstance in life without depending on this world&#39;s system or your own ability. Faith outside of the word of GOD is no way to live. We need to grab hold to GOD&#39;s word like never before and cleave to the promises that he has made for us through the Bible. We need to know it is GOD&#39;s will and desire for his children to live a blessed, prosperous, healthy, and happy life. We need to know that we can live this life through faith in GOD and overcome difficult times and challenges in life. In order to do this, we need to know GOD and how he has sent his word to us. We must  know how the power of GOD worked in the lives of   people in the Bible and that power is still available for us today to change situations and circumstances on our behalf today no matter what we are facing. It is up to us to take our faith out of this world&#39;s system and put it in GOD&#39;s system. This book will be an inspiration for you to redirect your faith to GOD and lean on GOD for direction in your life. GOD is good and he wants to see good things happen in the lives of his children. We can experience the life that GOD intended for us to have through understanding and accepting the love and the grace of GOD that has been given to us through faith in Jesus Christ." />
