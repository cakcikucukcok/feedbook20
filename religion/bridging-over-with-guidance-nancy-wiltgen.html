  <title>Bridging over with Guidance - Nancy Wiltgen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Like many of us, author Nancy Wiltgen learned to recite prayers as a child, prayers that stayed with her into adulthood. Then one day, worried about her daughter, Nancy prayed, unaware that she was about to start an amazing journey that would change her life forever. Mary began coming to her in beautiful visions and calling her nameeven as Nancy worked her factory job. Confused, yet drawn to the images and Marys voice, Nancy started reading the Bible, where she discovered that although she had talked to God, shed never learned to be still and listen to him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Written as a dialogue between herself and God, &lt;i&gt;Bridging Over with Guidance&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Nancys spiritual transformation, with insights that will speak to the heart of anyone seeking a deeper relationship with God. She is unafraid to ask him questions: Why did she have visions of Mary, and why did she stop having them? Why were certain people in her life? What was the reason behind some of the painful circumstances in the prayer group she attended? Whats more, she has learned to listen to his answers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From her newfound awareness of Satans attempts to interfere with her life to learning to cope with peoples discomfort with and disapproval of her new spirituality, Nancys path has led her to places she never anticipated. &lt;i&gt;Bridging Over with Guidance&lt;/i&gt; is about the experience of one womans discovery of the bridge between the spiritual world and everyday life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
