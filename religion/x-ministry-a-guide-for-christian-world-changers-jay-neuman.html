  <title>X-ministry: A Guide for Christian World Changers - Jay Neuman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has placed a ministry inside every Christian.  We feel it beating with every heartbeat.  Our purpose is found as we partner with Jesus to change the world around us.  That is our ministry calling.  But there&#39;s a problem.  For most of us our ministry does not have a name.  Pastors and evangelists have names for their ministries.  We have a blank waiting to be filled in by the story of our lives.  It is a placeholder waiting for a name.  It is an X.    Without a ministry label we can feel like we have no ministry at all.  We hear a subtle message that our careers and talents don&#39;t matter.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  God has mapped out a path that leads to fulfilling our calling.  Like all paths we must walk it to the end to see where it leads.  Before we can do that, we must find it.  And it is hidden.  This book will be your guide to finding your X.  It will show you how to walk your path.  At the end of your path, history will fill in the blank with the name of a world-changer." />
