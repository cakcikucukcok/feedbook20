  <title>Transformation Through the Different Other: A Rendezvous of Giving and Receiving - Faustin Ntamushobora, Robert L. Saucy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Transformation Through the Different Other is the story of Faustin Ntamushobora&#39;s transformation through encounters with people of different races, tribes, worldviews, and experiences, and how God has used these experiences to transform his life into the image of Christ.  The root cause of racial and tribal problems is not really the difference in color, but the human heart. However, differences in race, tribe, and worldview could widen the gap in people&#39;s hearts and cause more separation and strife. But the same heart, if transformed by the Great Other, can shape and sharpen the heart of one&#39;s fellow human being.   Ntamushobora acknowledges that community is very important for our transformation. Diversity in community, when developed with a sense of unity, can shape us into vessels that glorify the Lord by pouring into and receiving from those who are different from us.  The book ends with practical ways transformation through the other can become a reality, and an invitation to believers to prepare themselves for the time when every tongue, every tribe, and every race will stand together, singing praises to the Lamb of God who was slain for the redemption of every person from every nation." />
