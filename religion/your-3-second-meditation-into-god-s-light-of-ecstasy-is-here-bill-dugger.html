  <title>Your 3 Second Meditation into God’S Light of Ecstasy Is Here! - Bill Dugger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In book volume one we learned how organic life was created. We
also learned our purpose in life and where were going. Now in
book two were going much deeper into advanced meditation
skills. In order to create we need to get into the Light of Ecstasy in a
fl ash while working. God-awareness is what we need! In book two we
learn how to put into action what we learned in the 541 pages of book
one. Our request for guidance from God must be from Light of your
soul to the Light of God. We must be within the Light wordlessly to
understand God. Well actually experience ecstasy in book two with
the 3-second meditation skills we learned in book one." />
