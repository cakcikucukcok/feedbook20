  <title>Truth and the New Kind of Christian - R. Scott Smith, J. P. Moreland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The latest clarion call in the never-ending cavalcade of &quot;what&#39;s
new&quot; in the evangelical world is the confident assertion from some
quarters that the church needs to embrace &quot;postmodernism&quot; if it is
going to engage postmoderns effectively. Pastors trying to break
down the often indigestible subject matter of postmodernism into
bite-size chunks in order to equip their people to engage it, and
teachers who are aiming at giving their students a working
knowledge of the way postmodernism is impacting the church will
find a good deal of help from Smith.&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;J. Ligon Duncan III&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior Minister, First
Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Smith and I agree on a lot. We share a deep commitment to
Jesus Christ, a love of the Bible, and a passion for the church. We
also agree that we&#39;re currently living in a liminal time, and it&#39;s
those &quot;boundary times&quot; when people look most closely at the beliefs
that underlie their practices. So, we&#39;ve all got some things to
figure out right now, including what we can really know and the
certainty with which we can state our claims in a pluralistic
society. I appreciate Scott&#39;s voice in this conversation. He is a
careful reader of my work, and he writes with a gracious and
generous tone. Interlocutors like Scott will be a helpful challenge
to all of us in the &quot;emerging church.&quot; I consider him a friendly
critic and a brother in Christ.&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;Tony Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Postmodern Youth
Ministry&lt;/em&gt; and National Director, Emergent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Smith is uniquely suited to enter the Emergent
conversation with this helpful volume. Not only is he an analytic
philosopher with a razor-sharp mind who has specialized in
analyzing postmodernistic views on the relationship between
language and the world, but he is also a man who cares for the
lost, loves the church, and has an ability to communicate complex
truths to people in the pew.&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;Justin Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Editor, Desiring God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every leader in the new Emergent Movement will want to read this
fascinating book. They simply will not find a more engaging,
knowledgeable, balanced, and kind treatment of their concerns,
ideas, and practices.&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;Craig J. Hazen&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of Comparative
Religion, Biola University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Smith&#39;s study challenges us to take seriously the truth
claim of the gospel both in how we proclaim it in words and in how
we manifest it in our personal and community lives.&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;Gary Inrig&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior Pastor, Trinity Church,
Redlands, California&lt;/p&gt;" />
