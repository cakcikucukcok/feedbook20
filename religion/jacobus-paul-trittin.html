  <title>Jacobus - Paul Trittin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first century Roman Empire at fourteen, the legal age of manhood, Jacobus father contracted him to relatives in Sicily as an apprentice learning his Jewish familys shipping business. Being what the Greeks called a natural eunuch, he found himself living with two cut eunuch Carthaginian slaves who eventually became his lovers. As his apprenticeship progressed, the family recognized his natural leadership abilities surpassed his age. By sixteen he developed a strategy to enter the India trade which succeeded beyond expectations. He also become the second spouse of his cousin, the director of Aetna Shipping. 
Everything in his life changed when his brother-in-law, Simon from Cyrene, was awoken one night by a frightening vision causing some of the family, with their Judeo-Indian partners to take Simon to Jerusalem for Passover.
Preparing for another Indian voyage, in the city of Alexandria, Jacobus encountered the apostle Thomas entering a synagogue. Thomas decided to join them sailing up the Nile and then by ship to India where he served as a missionary for the rest of his life. In his senior years Jacobus traveled by elephant, with his faithful Carthaginian friend, from India to Jerusalem, witnessing the terror there." />
