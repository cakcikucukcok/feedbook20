  <title>Soaring with Eagles - James Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Soaring With Eagles is a book of devotional meditations upon the book of James. It helps us to deal with our trouble and suffering. I want to be in the line in Heaven, waiting to talk to James about his book. I want to recite my heartbreaks and ask James, &quot;Should I have been happy about these?&quot; I already anticipate his response, &quot;Yes, for suffering stretches you and brings all the character that God has already placed within you to the surface, or it diminishes you because you do not see its intended purpose and accept it.&quot;
The growth that suffering awakens in us will produce real faith, which shows itself in ministry to the poor, disenfranchised, downtrodden and needy people around us. This book is for all those who want to become real Christians instead of plastic Christians. All who yearn for true greatness should benefit from reading Soaring With Eagles. Readers should learn to laugh when suffering comes their way, knowing that suffering can be a gift from God. 
Soaring With Eagles should prepare readers for the time when life tumbles in. And, when it does, we will be drawn toward God instead of retreating away from Him." />
