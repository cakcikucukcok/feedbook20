  <title>Be Positive - Pj Edmund Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Faith then means we assume the confidence of things being real while knowing they are real based upon the confidence that we have in God and His ability to stand behind the evidence of that reality.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PJ EDMUND, Sr.&lt;/b&gt; in his well received book, &lt;i&gt;Be Positive Keep A Word of Faith in Your Mouth &lt;/i&gt;, he teaches faith is the principle and foundation for all success. It is central to the survival of all of us that believe. In many ways the places of worship that are filled to capacity every weekend deliver instruction in the understanding, the articulation and the application of faith. PJ Edmund, Sr., calls these gatherings universities of faith because they inspire learning about the central theme of our existence and relationship with God. This is where we learn the elements, the rudiments and the establishment of faith! &lt;p&gt;
Be Positive: Keep A Word of Faith in Your Mouth speaks to this concept of the university of faith. It describes the many empowering experiences that we must complete to continue to build faith. The path of faith is not always a linear one. It is the culmination of many journeys, eventualities and recommitments. &lt;p&gt;" />
