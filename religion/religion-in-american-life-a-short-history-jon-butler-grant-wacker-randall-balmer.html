  <title>Religion in American Life: A Short History - Jon Butler, Grant Wacker, Randall Balmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Quite ambitious, tracing religion in the United States from European colonization up to the 21st century.... The writing is strong throughout.--Publishers Weekly (starred review)  One can hardly do better than Religion in American Life.... A good read, especially for the uninitiated. The initiated might also read it for its felicity of narrative and the moments of illumination that fine scholars can inject even into stories we have all heard before. Read it.--Church History  This new edition of Religion in American Life, written by three of the countrys most eminent historians of religion, offers a superb overview that spans four centuries, illuminating the rich spiritual heritage central to nearly every event in our nations history. Beginning with the state of religious affairs in both the Old and New Worlds on the eve of colonization and continuing through to the present, the book covers all the major American religious groups, from Protestants, Jews, and Catholics to Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, Buddhists, and New Age believers. Revised and updated, the book includes expanded treatment of religion during the Great Depression, of the religious influences on the civil rights movement, and of utopian groups in the 19th century, and it now covers the role of religion during the 2008 presidential election, observing how completely religion has entered American politics." />
