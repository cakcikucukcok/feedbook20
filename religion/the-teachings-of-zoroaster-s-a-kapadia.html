  <title>The Teachings of Zoroaster - S.a. Kapadia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;I WILL now tell you who are assembled here the wise sayings of Mazda, the praises of Ahura, and the hymns of the Good Spirit, the sublime truth which I see rising out of these flames. You shall therefore hearken to the Soul of Nature. Contemplate the beams of fire with a most pious mind! Every one, both men and women, ought to-day to choose his creed. Ye offspring of renowned ancestors, awake to agree with us.&amp;rdquo; So preached Zoroaster, the prophet of the Parsis, in one of his earliest sermons nearly 3,500 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
Imbued from his infancy with deep philosophical and religious thoughts for the welfare and well-being of mankind, this ancient prophet of Bactria derived his holy inspiration after thirty years of divine meditation on a secluded and inaccessible mountain-top of &amp;ldquo;Ushidarena.&amp;rdquo; Thus fortified in communion with Ahura-Mazda, &amp;ldquo;Spitama Zarathustra&amp;rdquo; proceeded to the city of Balkh, at the time the capital of the King of Iran, Kava Vishta&amp;ccedil;pa.&lt;br /&gt;
Clothed in pure white flowing vestments, bearing with him the sacred fire, &amp;ldquo;Adar Burzin Mehr,&amp;rdquo; and a staff or sceptre made of a cypress tree, this sage of antiquity appeared before the court of Kava Vishta&amp;ccedil;pa. By persuasion and argument he unfolded his religious mission; and proclaimed the mandate of Ahura, in order to elevate the ancient faith of the Aryas to its lofty and intellectual purity of monotheism." />
