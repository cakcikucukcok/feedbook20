  <title>Understanding the Faith - Michael A. Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Out of the shadows of Pope John Paul II the Great comes an invigorating look at the Catholic faith. Father Michael Garcia takes a broad and sometimes overwhelming topicRoman Catholic theologyand makes it user-friendly for all. Having studied and taught theology for over twenty-five years, I find this book as the spark needed to fuel those searching for answers to the Catholic faith. Beginning from the standpoint of salvation history, Father Michael Garcias text takes the reader from the Fall to the Resurrection, awakening interest in students lacking theological acumen. In just a few pages, Father Michael Garcia delivers practical advice to living a life worthy of the trip to salvation. This brevity in unveiling religious truth is bound to captivate the reader. 
Miracles were never intended to be simply signs of power, or solutions to impossible problems, but rather, opportunities for change and conversion. This line from Father Michael Garcias new book is just one sample of the ingenious way that the author simplifies complex ideas, motivating even the average reader to discover more. Whether the audience consists of accomplished theologians or recent converts to the Roman Catholic faith, this book quenches the readers desire for knowledge and religious understanding. Father Michael Garcia&#39;s text is certain to imbue his readers with a fresh perspective regarding their faith. It is not only a theological primer but also a practical look at how to apply the consistent church teaching to the realities of life in the twenty-first century. When readers put down this book, they will have picked up an appreciation of the Catholic faith." />
