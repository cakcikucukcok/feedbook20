  <title>Bhagavad Gita: The Scripture of Mankind - Swami Tapasyananda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This pocket edition of the Bhagavad G?t? is specially meant for those who do not know the Devan?gar? script and would like to have the Text in Roman script with a plain English translation. It will be useful also for those who want to carry a great scripture even to their work spot in order to seek holy company in the midst of work. Though put in the context of a battle scene, the object of the G?t? is not war - mongering but exhorting man to do his duty, whatever it be, in a spirit of detachment and dedication. Such an attitude can be sustained only if a man has unreserved faith in God and in His supremacy over the destiny of man individually and of the cosmos as a whole. So beginning with an exhortation to action, the G?t? gives in substantiation of that teaching a universal theology without any sectarian or dogmatic stance, which would be found congenial by all who are not in the grip of those narrow loyalties. For this reason we have designated it as the scripture of mankind." />
