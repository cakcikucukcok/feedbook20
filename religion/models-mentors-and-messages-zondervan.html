  <title>Models, Mentors, and Messages - Zondervan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For far too long we&amp;rsquo;ve neglected the urban mission field. Many churches have moved to the outskirts of the city for various reasons, and the urban landscape appears to be forgotten. Dr. Ren&amp;eacute; Rochester presents a vision for how communities can change this pattern and plant redemptive and sustainable urban ministries. Models, Mentors, and Messages takes a close look at the developmental stages of Jesus&amp;rsquo; life, focusing on how family, his heavenly Father, the Jewish community, and neighboring nations were used to shape his holy destiny. Through the example of Jesus&amp;rsquo; life, you will learn how to draw on your own formative years to show urban teens how to live out God&amp;rsquo;s call in their communities. The most authentic models are individuals who have wrestled through life&amp;rsquo;s challenges and learned to trust God in difficult situations, and so by empowering urban students today and showing them how to nurture one another in faith, you can help create sustainable ministries in which each generation will model for the next how to follow Jesus. The first of its kind, this book doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to force old models on the urban context, but rather teaches new ways to draw on Jesus&amp;rsquo; teachings to help an urban, hip-hop generation live for Jesus and for one another.&lt;/p&gt;" />
