  <title>Vigilant Faith: Passionate Agnosticism in a Secular World - Daniel Boscaljon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Vigilant Faith: Passionate Agnosticism in a Secular     World,&lt;/i&gt; Daniel Boscaljon takes up the contemporary challenges to faith by skepticism     and secularism. He proposes a model of faith for believers and unbelievers alike-a passionate     agnosticism-that is rooted in a skeptical consciousness. Skepticism and faith are structurally     similar, he writes, in that they share an &quot;unknowing&quot; quality. The author argues that     vigilance-the act of keeping watch, a spiritual practice in its own right-is as necessary a     precondition for the structure of faith as it is for the structure of skepticism. A suspension     in uncertainty and an openness to possibility require vigilance, he attests, if faith and     skepticism are to avoid the often dogmatic tendencies of both theism and atheism to cling to     their own brands of certainty and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boscaljon has three aims: to     expand the current, post-theistic definitions of God for greater relevance to human beings on an     individual and existential level; to integrate skepticism into faith so that it will restore the     importance of faith to current theology and recover it from anti-intellectual bias; and to     conceptualize the vigilance of faith in such a way that can provide a vocabulary for     distinguishing &quot;good faith&quot; from &quot;bad faith.&quot; He offers a variety of cultural examples ranging     from film to poetry to represent a life of faith and to show how its components come together in     practice. As an alternative to the prevailing fundamentalisms in today&#39;s world, his book     proposes a paradigmatic understanding of faith in which theism, atheism, and agnosticism refuse     to differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
