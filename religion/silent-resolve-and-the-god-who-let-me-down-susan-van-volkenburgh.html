  <title>Silent Resolve and the God Who Let Me Down - Susan Van Volkenburgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life for Susan Van Volkenburgh was good. She was often told that God had placed a golden star upon her life. Then tragedy struck. On September 11, 2001 at 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77 plummeted into the Pentagon, taking the lives of 184 innocent people. One of them was Susans father, Stanley R. Hall. At that moment, everything changed for Susan. Everything she knew, everything she ever believed in, came crashing down. Her life began to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;How could she face God in light of all that had happened? How could she ever trust Him again? Wasnt God supposed to protect His own? Nothing made sense anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This ten-year journey through the desert, through a land where God was silent, was a time of trial and of spiritual awakening. Could faith endure in the face of so great a loss, so large a betrayal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Transcending the events of September 11, this spiritual odyssey moves through the mire of grief and loss, to question the very motives and promises of God. As Susan asks the tough questions, can the silent resolve of her own father speak to her from beyond the veil? Is there a place for faith when God has let you down?&lt;/p&gt;
