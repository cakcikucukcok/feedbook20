  <title>The Sexuality of Migration - Lionel Cantu, Nancy A. Naples, Salvador Vidal-Ortiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2010 Distinguished Book Award from the American Sociological Association, Sociology of Sexualities Section &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2010 Distinguished Book Award in Latino Studies Honorable Mention from the Latin American Studies Association&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sexuality of Migration&lt;/b&gt; provides an innovative study of the experiences of Mexican men who have same sex with men and who have migrated to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, immigration scholars have left out the experiences of gays and lesbians. In fact, the topic of sexuality has only recently been addressed in the literature on immigration. &lt;b&gt;The Sexuality of Migration&lt;/b&gt; makes significant connections among sexuality, state institutions, and global economic relations. Cant&amp;#250;; situates his analysis within the history of Mexican immigration and offers a broad understanding of diverse migratory experiences ranging from recent gay asylum seekers to an assessment of gay tourism in Mexico. Cant&amp;#250; uses a variety of methods including archival research, interviews, and ethnographic research to explore the range of experiences of Mexican men who have sex with men and the political economy of sexuality and immigration. His primary research site is the greater Los Angeles area, where he interviewed many immigrant men and participated in organizations and community activities alongside his informants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure to fill gaps in the field, &lt;b&gt;The Sexuality of Migration&lt;/b&gt; simultaneously complicates a fixed notion of sexual identity and explores the complex factors that influence immigration and migration experiences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
