  <title>Economy of the Peoples Republic of China - Dr. S K Shah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today, China’s economy is behaving in a rather similar way to most other countries. This is true even after the government’s influence on industry which in some sectors is similar to what we see in some European countries such as France. China uses the same measurement yardsticks for GDP, foreign trade, inflation, industrial output, etc. as almost every other country. As such, comparisons are possible and called for. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the world’s second largest economy by nominal GDP and by purchasing power parity after the United States. It is the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with growth rates averaging 10%over the past 30 years. China is also the largest exporter and second largest importer of goods in the world. On a per capita income basis, China ranked 90th by nominal GDP and 91st by GDP (PPP) in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The provinces in the coastal regions of China tend to be more industrialized, while regions in the hinterland are less developed. As China’s economic importance has grown, so has attention to the structure and health of the economy. Growth in the People&#39;s Republic of China&#39;s restructuring economy continued to decelerate in 2016, but the government ensured stability through targeted fiscal and monetary support. Inflation started to rise, and the current account surplus narrowed but remained sizeable. These trends will continue in 2017 and 2018. Structural reform needs to be accelerated to boost productivity and sustain growth as outlined in the current 5-year plan. As the book addresses this crucial issue quite deftly, it is hoped that it would prove to be a source of great information for the reader." />
