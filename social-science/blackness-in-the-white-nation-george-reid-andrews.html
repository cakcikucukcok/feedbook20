  <title>Blackness in the White Nation - George Reid Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Uruguay is not conventionally thought of as part of the African diaspora, yet during the period of Spanish colonial rule, thousands of enslaved Africans arrived in the country. Afro-Uruguayans played important roles in Uruguay&#39;s national life, creating the second-largest black press in Latin America, a racially defined political party, and numerous social and civic organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afro-Uruguayans were also central participants in the creation of Uruguayan popular culture and the country&#39;s principal musical forms, tango and &lt;i&gt;candombe&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Candombe&lt;/i&gt;, a style of African-inflected music, is one of the defining features of the nation&#39;s culture, embraced equally by white and black citizens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Blackness in the White Nation&lt;/i&gt;, George Reid Andrews offers a comprehensive history of Afro-Uruguayans from the colonial period to the present. Showing how social and political mobilization is intertwined with &lt;i&gt;candombe&lt;/i&gt;, he traces the development of Afro-Uruguayan racial discourse and argues that &lt;i&gt;candombe&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s evolution as a central part of the nation&#39;s culture has not fundamentally helped the cause of racial equality. Incorporating lively descriptions of his own experiences as a member of a &lt;i&gt;candombe&lt;/i&gt; drumming and performance group, Andrews consistently connects the struggles of Afro-Uruguayans to the broader issues of race, culture, gender, and politics throughout Latin America and the African diaspora generally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
