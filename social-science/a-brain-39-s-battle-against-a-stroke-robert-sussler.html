&lt;P&gt;brain can be life threatening , leave permanent damage, or require the&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;patient to do daily battle with his own brain.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The recovery of the stroke patient requires the specialist to treat , to understand and to involve the whole patient and not just the.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;physical damage and the cause. . Today , medicine concentrates on the physical damage and the cause as determined by the technology and the corrective treatment within each specialty Specialists lack the time to make patients part of the curing .&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My recovery from a stroke illustrates that the recovery was inadvertently&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;set back and impeded .The failure to recognize my lack of knowledge&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;about my medical problem and to devote the time necessary to make me fully&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;understand the stroke damage left me feeling like medical garbage .Until a specialist took the time to explain the brain damage and its affect in language that I understood , I was my own worst enemy on the road to recovery &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An early period of medicine , fifty years ago , with more limited scientific knowledge , lacking technology and pharmaceuticals, had to focus on the whole&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;the disease or injury but often knew the recovery was more dependent on the&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;patient than the scientific advancements that did not exist. &lt;/P&gt;
