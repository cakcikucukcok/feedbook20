  <title>A Reenchanted World - James William Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A surprising and enlightening investigation of how modern society is making nature sacred once again&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than two centuries, Western cultures, as they became ever more industrialized, increasingly regarded the natural world as little more than a collection of useful raw resources. The folklore of powerful forest spirits and mountain demons was displaced by the practicalities of logging and strip-mining; the traditional rituals of hunting ceremonies gave way to the indiscriminate butchering of animals for meat markets. In the famous lament of Max Weber, our surroundings became &quot;disenchanted,&quot; with nature&#39;s magic swept away by secularization and rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, as acclaimed sociologist James William Gibson reveals in this insightful study, the culture of enchantment is making an astonishing comeback. From Greenpeace eco-warriors to evangelical Christians preaching &quot;creation care&quot; and geneticists who speak of human-animal kinship, Gibson finds a remarkably broad yearning for a spiritual reconnection to nature. As we grapple with increasingly dire environmental disasters, he points to this cultural shift as the last utopian dream--the final hope for protecting the world that all of us must live in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
