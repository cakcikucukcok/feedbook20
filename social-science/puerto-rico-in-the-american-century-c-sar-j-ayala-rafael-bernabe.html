  <title>Puerto Rico in the American Century - César J. Ayala, Rafael Bernabe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Offering a comprehensive overview of Puerto Rico&#39;s history and evolution since the installation of U.S. rule, Cesar Ayala and Rafael Bernabe connect the island&#39;s economic, political, cultural, and social past. &lt;i&gt;Puerto Rico in the American Century&lt;/i&gt; explores Puerto Ricans in the diaspora as well as the island residents, who experience an unusual and daily conundrum: they consider themselves a distinct people but are part of the American political system; they have U.S. citizenship but are not represented in the U.S. Congress; and they live on land that is neither independent nor part of the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlighting both well-known and forgotten figures from Puerto Rican history, Ayala and Bernabe discuss a wide range of topics, including literary and cultural debates and social and labor struggles that previous histories have neglected. Although the island&#39;s political economy remains dependent on the United States, the authors also discuss Puerto Rico&#39;s situation in light of world economies. Ayala and Bernabe argue that the inability of Puerto Rico to shake its colonial legacy reveals the limits of free-market capitalism, a break from which would require a renewal of the long tradition of labor and social activism in Puerto Rico in connection with similar currents in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--copy for pb cover:&lt;br/&gt;Offering a comprehensive overview of Puerto Rico&#39;s history and evolution since the installation of U.S. rule, Cesar Ayala and Rafael Bernabe connect the island&#39;s economic, political, cultural, and social past. &lt;i&gt;Puerto Rico in the American Century&lt;/i&gt; explores the history of Puerto Ricans in the diaspora as well as the island residents, who experience an unusual and daily conundrum: they consider themselves a distinct people but are part of the American political system; they have U.S. citizenship but are not represented in the U.S. Congress; and they live on an island that is neither independent nor part of the United States.
