  <title>History of Woman Suffrage Vol 2 - Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, And Matilda Joslyn Gage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;In presenting to our readers, the second volume of the &amp;ldquo;History of Woman Suffrage,&amp;rdquo; we gladly return our thanks to the press for the many favorable notices we have received from leading journals, both in the old world and the new. The words of cordial approval from a large circle of friends, and especially from women well known in periodical literature, have been to us a constant stimulus during the toilsome months we have spent in gathering material for these pages. It was our purpose to have condensed the records of the last twenty years in a second volume, but so many new questions in regard to Citizenship, State rights, and National power, indirectly bearing on the political rights of women, grew out of the civil war, that the arguments and decisions in Congress and the Supreme Courts have combined to swell these pages beyond our most liberal calculations, with much valuable material that cannot be condensed nor ignored, making a third volume inevitable&amp;quot;." />
