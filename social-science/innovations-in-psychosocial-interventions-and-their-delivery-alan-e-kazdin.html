  <title>Innovations in Psychosocial Interventions and Their Delivery - Alan E. Kazdin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of children, adolescents, and adults worldwide experience significant mental health problems, for which they receive no treatment whatsoever. Despite decades of world-class, innovative treatment research, growing governmental and public attention to mental health issues, and decreasing stigma around seeking care, the supply of tools and resources available to combat the burdens of mental illness globally are vastly outweighed by demand for services.
&lt;em&gt;Innovations in Psychosocial Interventions and Their Delivery&lt;/em&gt; provides an integrated and detailed overview of advances, challenges, and necessary new directions with regard to evidence-based psychological interventions. Drawing on diverse fields such as public health, business, entertainment, social policy and law, and other domains that may inform efforts to deliver interventions more effectively, Alan Kazdin explores an assortment of novel and inventive ways to address the world&#39;s mental health crisis. Focusing attention on promising scientific developments and the special challenges that emerge in evaluating and delivering such interventions, the book examines opportunities such as trans-diagnostic treatments, inventive uses of technology, complementary approaches, novel methods of dissemination such as task-shifting, and more. The first to bring together such diverse perspectives in an effort to show precisely and practically how treatments could be delivered effectively and in a scalable manner,&lt;em&gt; Innovations in Psychosocial Interventions and Their Delivery&lt;/em&gt; has direct and immediate implications for health care systems but also for research and clinical practice in the mental health professions. It will be of keen interest to those in psychology, psychiatry, social work, family studies, counseling, nursing, and healthcare administration." />
