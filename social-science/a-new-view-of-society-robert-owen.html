  <title>A New View of Society - Robert Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Owen&amp;nbsp;was a&amp;nbsp;Welshtextile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of&amp;nbsp;utopian socialism&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;cooperative&amp;nbsp;movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In the early 1800s Owen became wealthy as an investor and eventual manager of a large textile mill at&amp;nbsp;New Lanark,&amp;nbsp;Scotland. (He initially trained as a&amp;nbsp;draper&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Stamford, Lincolnshire, and worked in&amp;nbsp;London&amp;nbsp;before relocating at the age of 18 to&amp;nbsp;Manchester&amp;nbsp;and going into business as a textile manufacturer.) In 1824 Owen travelled to America, where he invested the bulk of his fortune in an experimental socialistic community at&amp;nbsp;New Harmony, Indiana, the preliminary model for Owen&amp;#39;s utopian society. The experiment was short-lived, lasting about two years. Other&amp;nbsp;Oweniteutopian communities met a similar fate. In 1828 Owen returned to the&amp;nbsp;United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;and settled in London, where he continued to be an advocate for the working class. In addition to his leadership in the development of&amp;nbsp;cooperatives&amp;nbsp;and the trade union movement, he also supported passage of child labour laws and free, co-educational schools." />
