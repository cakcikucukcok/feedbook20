  <title>Yours in Sisterhood - Amy Erdman Farrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;In the winter of 1972, the first issue of &lt;i&gt;Ms.&lt;/i&gt; magazine hit the newsstands. For some activists in the women&#39;s movement, the birth of this new publication heralded feminism&#39;s coming of age; for others, it signaled the capitulation of the women&#39;s movement to crass commercialism. But whatever its critical reception, &lt;i&gt;Ms.&lt;/i&gt; quickly gained national success, selling out its first issue in only eight days and becoming a popular icon of the women&#39;s movement almost immediately.&lt;br/&gt;     Amy Erdman Farrell traces the history of &lt;i&gt;Ms.&lt;/i&gt; from its pathbreaking origins in 1972 to its final commercial issue in 1989. Drawing on interviews with former&lt;br/&gt;editors, archival materials, and the text of &lt;i&gt;Ms.&lt;/i&gt; itself, she &lt;/i&gt;examines the &lt;/i&gt;magazine&#39;s efforts to forge an oppositional politics within the context of commercial culture.&lt;br/&gt;     While its &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;status as a feminist &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; mass media magazine gave &lt;i&gt;Ms.&lt;/i&gt; the power to move in circles unavailable to smaller, more radical feminist periodicals, it also created competing and conflicting pressures, says Farrell. She examines the complicated decisions made by the &lt;i&gt;Ms.&lt;/i&gt; staff as they negotiated the multiple--frequently incompatible--demands of advertisers, readers, and the various and changing constituencies of the feminist movement. &lt;br/&gt;     An engrossing and objective account, &lt;i&gt;Yours in Sisterhood&lt;/i&gt; illuminates the significant yet difficult connections between commercial culture and social movements. It reveals a complex, often contradictory magazine that was a major force in the contemporary feminist movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
