  <title>America Is the Prison - Lee Bernstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the 1970s, while politicians and activists outside prisons debated the proper response to crime, incarcerated people helped shape those debates though a broad range of remarkable political and literary writings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lee Bernstein explores the forces that sparked a dramatic &quot;prison art renaissance,&quot; shedding light on how incarcerated people produced powerful works of writing, performance, and visual art. These included everything from George Jackson&#39;s revolutionary &lt;i&gt;Soledad Brother&lt;/i&gt; to Miguel Pinero&#39;s acclaimed off-Broadway play and Hollywood film &lt;i&gt;Short Eyes&lt;/i&gt;. An extraordinary range of prison programs--fine arts, theater, secondary education, and prisoner-run programs--allowed the voices of prisoners to influence the Black Arts Movement, the Nuyorican writers, &quot;New Journalism,&quot; and political theater, among the most important aesthetic contributions of the decade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the 1980s and &#39;90s, prisoners&#39; educational and artistic programs were scaled back or eliminated as the &quot;war on crime&quot; escalated. But by then these prisoners&#39; words had crossed over the wall, helping many Americans to rethink the meaning of the walls themselves and, ultimately, the meaning of the society that produced them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
