  <title>Women with Alcoholic Husbands - Ramona M. Asher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this important study of women with alcoholic husbands, Asher vividly describes the process of coming to terms with a profound crisis in one&#39;s private life. From interviews with more than fifty women, all of whom were participants in family treatment programs, she assembles a composite picture of the experiences shared by wives of alcoholics. The testimony given by these women illustrates the steps they must take to regain control of their lives. The first step is figuring out what is happening and deciding what to do about it. Asher argues that the vogue of using the label &quot;codependent&quot; may actually hinder rather than facilitate emotional health. Led to think of themselves as addicted to their husbands&#39; addictions the wives of alcoholics may be persuaded that their own problems can&#39;t be overcome. But, Asher shows, these women can take command of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1992. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print. These editions are published unaltered from the original, and are presented in affordable paperback formats, bringing readers both historical and cultural value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
