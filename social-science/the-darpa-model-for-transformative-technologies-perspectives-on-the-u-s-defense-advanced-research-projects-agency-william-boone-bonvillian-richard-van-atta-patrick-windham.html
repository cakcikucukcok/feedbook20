  <title>The DARPA Model for Transformative Technologies: Perspectives on the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - William Boone Bonvillian,  Richard Van Atta, Patrick Windham </title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has played a remarkable role in the creation new transformative technologies, revolutionizing defense with drones and precision-guided munitions, and transforming civilian life with portable GPS receivers, voice-recognition software, self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and, most famously, the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other parts of the U.S. Government and some foreign governments have tried to apply the &amp;lsquo;DARPA model&amp;rsquo; to help develop valuable new technologies. But how and why has DARPA succeeded? Which features of its operation and environment contribute to this success? And what lessons does its experience offer for other U.S. agencies and other governments that want to develop and demonstrate their own &amp;lsquo;transformative technologies&amp;rsquo;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a remarkable collection of leading academic research on DARPA from a wide range of perspectives, combining to chart an important story from the Agency&amp;rsquo;s founding in the wake of Sputnik, to the current attempts to adapt it to use by other federal agencies. Informative and insightful, this guide is essential reading for political and policy leaders, as well as researchers and students interested in understanding the success of this agency and the lessons it offers to others.&lt;br /&gt;
