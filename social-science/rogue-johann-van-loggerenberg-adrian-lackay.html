  <title>Rogue - Johann van Loggerenberg, Adrian Lackay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of a ‘rogue unit’ operating within the South African Revenue Service (SARS) became entrenched in the public mind following a succession of sensational reports published by the Sunday Times in 2014. The unit, the reports claimed, had carried out a series of illegal spook operations: they had spied on President Jacob Zuma, run a brothel, illegally bought spyware and entered into unlawful tax settlements. 
&lt;p&gt;In a plot of Machiavellian proportions, head of the elite crime-busting unit Johann van Loggerenberg and many of SARS’s top management were forced to resign. Van Loggerenberg’s select team of investigators, with their impeccable track record of busting high-level financial fraudsters and nailing tax criminals, lost not only their careers but also their reputations. 
&lt;p&gt;Now, in this extraordinary account, they finally get to put the record straight and the rumours to rest:  there was no ‘rogue unit’. The public had been deceived, seemingly by powers conspiring to capture SARS for their own ends. 
&lt;p&gt;Shooting down the allegations he has faced one by one, Van Loggerenberg tells the story of what really happened inside SARS, revealing details of some of the unit’s actual investigations.&lt;ip&gt;" />
