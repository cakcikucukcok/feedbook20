Its said that you know when a Liberal is lying whenever you see his lips move. In modern politics the variety and severity of Liberal lies, and the deception perpetrated on the American people, cannot be ignored. Unfortunately, sports scandals and celebrity gossip receive far more attention from the average American than do the immoral and sometimes illegal actions demonstrated by Democrats and Liberals in American politics.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Liberals have employed junk science and gathered environmental activist judges to institute policy on an issue that is as phony as the tooth fairy. By manufacturing a crisis, the Left has created panic and hysteria among nave and unsuspecting Americans. According to the Left, the only way to address global warming is to regulate our behavior and tax the hell out of us. This is the typical Liberal approach to any problem. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
