  <title>Rally Point - Chris Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A smart and surprising political inventory for how America can reunite and revitalize in a time of crisis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Written by an admired leader of the Republican party, Rally Point: &lt;i&gt;Five Tasks to Unite the Country and Revitalize the American Dream&lt;/i&gt; looks past the 2016 election, past the finger pointing and conventional political thinking, to focus on clear, primary principles that conservatives must debate and defend to protect the future of America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Raised in a working-class family in upstate New York, the first in his family to go to college, paid for in part by his service in the National Guard, Chris Gibson rose from Private to Colonel in the Army, including combat command in the storied 82nd Airborne Division. RALLY POINT is his story: what he&#39;s learned from the &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; and how he&#39;s applied those precious life lessons during his service in Iraq and in Congress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Drawn from a deep appreciation of history and American exceptionalism, Gibson provides incisive and frank analysis of the current political environment, including President Trump, and provides a roadmap based on time-tested Founding principles to help unite our country and revitalize the American Dream. RALLY POINT is a thoughtful, compelling, enjoyable read - a must for serious-minded Americans looking for answers in this challenging political environment." />
