  <title>Ethnic Entrepreneurs - Monica DeHart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Indigenous groups are not often recognized as driving forces in the push for economic development. However, in development efforts across Latin America, governments and corporations have begun to see ethnic cultural difference as an advantage. &lt;I&gt;Ethnic Entrepreneurs&lt;/I&gt; explores how diverse groups historically seen as obstacles to development have become valuable to state and regional development initiatives.
From collaboration between a Maya organization and Walmart to a UN-sponsored program that recruits diasporic Latinos, states and corporations are pursuing strategies that complement regional neoliberal shifts. This book examines how ethnic difference is produced through development policy, breaking down the micropolitics of identity and development. It uncovers surprising convergences between ethnic community businesses and corporate social responsibility practices and illuminates how formulations of ethnic difference influence not only changing cultural identifications, but also the political and moral projects that shape Latin America." />
