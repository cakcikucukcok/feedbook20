  <title>I Hear My People Singing - Kathryn Watterson, Cornel West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Hear My People Singing&lt;/i&gt; shines a light on a small but historic black neighborhood at the heart of one of the most elite and world-renowned Ivy-League towns&amp;#8212;Princeton, New Jersey. The vivid first-person accounts of more than fifty black residents detail aspects of their lives throughout the twentieth century. Their stories show that the roots of Princeton&amp;#8217;s African American community are as deeply intertwined with the town and university as they are with the history of the United States, the legacies of slavery, and the nation&amp;#8217;s current conversations on race.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawn from an oral history collaboration with residents of the Witherspoon-Jackson neighborhood, Princeton undergraduates, and their professor, Kathryn Watterson, neighbors speak candidly about Jim Crow segregation, the consequences of school integration, World Wars I and II, and the struggles for equal opportunities and civil rights. Despite three centuries of legal and economic obstacles, African American residents have created a flourishing, ethical, and humane neighborhood in which to raise their children, care for the sick and elderly, worship, stand their ground, and celebrate life. Abundantly filled with photographs, &lt;i&gt;I Hear My People Singing&lt;/i&gt; personalizes the injustices faced by generations of black Princetonians&amp;#8212;including the famed Paul Robeson&amp;#8212;and highlights the community&amp;#8217;s remarkable achievements. The introductions to each chapter provide historical context, as does the book&amp;#8217;s foreword by noted scholar, theologian, and activist Cornel West.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An intimate testament of the black community&amp;#8217;s resilience and ingenuity, &lt;i&gt;I Hear My People Singing&lt;/i&gt; adds a never-before-compiled account of poignant black experience to an American narrative that needs to be heard now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
