  <title>Fire In the East: The Rise of Asian Military Power and the Second Nuclear Age - Paul Bracken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On May 11, 1998, India began testing nuclear weapons. &lt;br /&gt;The world will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian test of five atomic bombs, and the Pakistani tests that answered a few weeks later, marked the end of the arms control system that has kept the world from nuclear war for half a century. As Paul Bracken, professor of management and political science at Yale University, explains in this landmark study, they signal the reemergence of something the world hasn&#39;t seen since the sixteenth century-modern technologically adept military powers on the mainland of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Fire in the East&lt;/em&gt;, Professor Bracken reveals several alarming trends and secrets, such as how close Isreal actually came to a germ warfare attack during the Gulf War, why &quot;globalization&quot; will spur the development of weapons of mass destruction, how American interests are endangered by Asian nationalism, and how to navigate what he names the second nuclear age. &lt;em&gt;Fire in the East&lt;/em&gt; is a provocative account of how the Western monopoly on modern arms is coming to an end, and how it will forever transform America&#39;s role on the stage of international politics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
