  <title>The Big Redhead Book - Erin La Rosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Big Redhead Book: Inside the Secret Society of Red Hair&lt;/i&gt; is an inside look into one of the most elite societies in the world--the real two percent. Well, you know, the two percent of the world&#39;s population that are natural redheads, at least. This book has equal parts pop culture, ginger facts, and humorous stories about what it&#39;s like to actually have red hair. It&#39;s loaded with everything you&#39;d ever want to know about us reds; how we&#39;re scientifically different from the norms (non-redheads), how we&#39;ve been stereotyped in pop culture, and the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of having a red in your life, among other things!&lt;br&gt;Whether you are a redhead, know a redhead, or are just an enthusiast, this book explores the realities, the myths, and where red hair actually originates (it&#39;s not Ireland). Author Erin La Rosa not only delivers the facts, statistics, and undeniable realities of being a ginger, but she also weaves in her own personal and hilarious stories about being red. Being a redhead is not just a hair color, it&#39;s a lifestyle--and this book is your own exclusive peek into that fabulous world.&lt;br&gt;Some surprising facts about redheads that you will discover include:&lt;br&gt;- The association between redheads and humor came from redheaded slaves in ancient Greece&lt;br&gt;- There are over 30 leading or recurring redhead characters in Disney and Pixar films... that&#39;s a lot when you remember we&#39;re only two percent of the world&#39;s population!&lt;br&gt;- Redhead women allegedly have more sex, more threesomes, and more orgasms than other women... or do they? Let&#39;s find out!&lt;br&gt;- Some Egyptian rulers dyed their hair red to assert their power (looking at you, Cleopatra)&lt;br&gt;- And redheads need more anesthesia at the dentist, because they&#39;re not going down without a fight&lt;/p&gt;" />
