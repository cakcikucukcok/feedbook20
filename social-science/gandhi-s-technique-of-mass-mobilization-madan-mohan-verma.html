  <title>Gandhi’S Technique of Mass Mobilization - Madan Mohan Verma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi lived during a time of intense struggle, but he envisioned a world where people could live in harmony.
Madan Mohan Verma explores how he appealed to such a diverse population in the second edition of his landmark book exploring Gandhis techniques. Learn how Gandhi:
cultivated the loyalty of the Indian masses;
trusted his instincts in determining how the masses felt;
combined the best values of Indian culture;
reconciled the conflicting interests of the haves and have-nots.
While some have attributed a sort of mysticism to Gandhis leadership, its dangerous to assign him supernatural powers. His methods were commonly used by leaders in the Western worldbut few could duplicate his skill in applying them.
Gandhi used to say, My life is my message. Therefore, when researching his techniques, its critical to turn to his life to understand the ideals he stood for and how he worked toward and promoted a richer concept of democracy.
Explore how the greatest leader of modern times launched a revolution and gained influence over the masses with this in-depth account highlighting Gandhis Technique of Mass Mobilization." />
