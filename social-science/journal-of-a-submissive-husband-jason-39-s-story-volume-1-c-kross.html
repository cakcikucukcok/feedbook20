  <title>Journal of a Submissive Husband: Jason&#39;s Story Volume 1 - C. Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So, here I am, sitting ay my wife&#39;s law firm event party of the year. It is always held in a ballroom at a five-star hotel every year. My wife, Victoria, was a lawyer in a law firm. Not necessarily true, she was one of the partners in one of the biggest law firms in our city, if not state. Her firm handles all sorts of clients from corporations to hospitals to multi-millionaires. Yeah, the big time.     See that beautiful women dressed in the royal blue Versace dress? The one with the long wavy auburn red hair, glowing green eyes, long legs, tight round ass, round but perky breasts and the perfect smile and charm that made any healthy straight man do a double take of her when she walks into a room. Hell, who am I kidding? She can make a gay man do a double take as well.    My wife, men wanted her and women wanted to be her. She carried an air of confidence that the first lady of the U.S.A. would envy. She could work a room like a politician and carry herself gracefully like a queen." />
