  <title>If You Build It They Will Come - Jeffrey E. Barnett, Jeffrey Zimmerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Private mental health practice is a vibrant, thriving, and financially rewarding profession. And yet many who consider pursuing this path are misled by falsehoods, or myths, about private practice that can result in costly mistakes - or avoidance of this fulfilling and worthwhile career path. &lt;em&gt;There is no need to market my practice, clients will find me. I learned everything I need to know about private practice in graduate school. I don&#39;t need an attorney or a CPA. Self-care is for students.&lt;/em&gt; But there is, you didn&#39;t, you do, and no, it most certainly is not.
In &lt;em&gt;If You Build It They Will Come&lt;/em&gt;, Jeffrey Barnett and Jeffrey Zimmerman dismantle many common misconceptions (myths) relating to the preparation, management, and ethics of entering and running a successful private practice in the mental health professions. Grouped into thematic sections, misconceptions are addressed briefly and succinctly. In addition to sharing accurate information to refute each myth, the book provides vital information on how to be successful in private practice. The authors identify common pitfalls and challenges, offering specific and practical strategies to address and move beyond the myth. Each chapter concludes with recommended resources and readings. Blending decades of clinical experience with practical no-nonsense advice about running a practice, &lt;em&gt;If You Build It They Will Come&lt;/em&gt; helps fill the gaps in practice development training. Trainees and recent graduates of programs in clinical psychology, social work, and counseling will benefit from this book&#39;s personal, candid, and optimistic approach." />
