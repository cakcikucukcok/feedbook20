  <title>Unity &amp; Diversity, the challenges of the Burmese transition - Carine Jaquet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After more than half a century of military dictatorship, Myanmar is  experiencing an unprecedented political transition since its  Independence in 1948. The first semi-civilian government took function  in 2011. Since then, it has been trying to pacify the country, which had  faced the longest civil war of history for more than 60 years, and to  open its economy, inherited from a heavy and fossilized state system.  The current government officially recognizes at least 135 ethnic groups  in a country slightly larger than France. Having to deal with such a  mosaic, the central power always tried to unify the country from the  independence of 1948, politically when possible, militarily when it met  resistances.&lt;br/&gt;
Due to its complexity and to the fact that it may endanger both the  economy and security of the country, the handling of the ethnic and  religious diversity will be a determinant factor for the future of  Myanmar and for the long-term impact of its current transition.&lt;/p&gt;
