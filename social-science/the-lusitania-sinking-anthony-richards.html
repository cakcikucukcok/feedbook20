  <title>The Lusitania Sinking - Anthony Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Uncertain of their son’s fate, his family leaped into action.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The sinking of the passenger liner &lt;i&gt;Lusitania&lt;/i&gt; was a maritime disaster that may have changed the course of history by making American involvement in World War I almost inevitable. This part of the story has been told before but here, for the first time, &lt;i&gt;The Lusitania Sinking&lt;/i&gt; has a far more personal tale to tell, of a family looking for information on their son’s death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On 1 May 1915 Preston Prichard, a 29-year-old student, embarked as a second-class passenger on the &lt;i&gt;Lusitania&lt;/i&gt;, bound from New York for Liverpool. Just after 2 p.m. on 7 May, a single torpedo, fired by the German submarine &lt;i&gt;U-20&lt;/i&gt;, caused a massive explosion in the &lt;i&gt;Lusitania&lt;/i&gt;’s hold, and the ship began sinking rapidly. Within 20 minutes she disappeared and 1,198 men, women and children, including Preston, died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Preston’s mother wrote hundreds of letters to survivors to find out more about what might have happened in his last moments. The replies she received included an extensive selection of moving and evocative survivors’ accounts. Although this was not Mrs Prichard’s intention, she thus assembled an outstanding collection of vivid first-hand recollections. &lt;i&gt;The Lusitania Sinking&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of this tragedy using this previously unseen historical treasure trove." />
