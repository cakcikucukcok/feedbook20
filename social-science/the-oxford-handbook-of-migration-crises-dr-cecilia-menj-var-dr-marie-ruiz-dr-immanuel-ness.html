  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Migration Crises - Dr. Cecilia Menjívar, Dr. Marie Ruiz, Dr. Immanuel Ness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of &lt;em&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Migration Crises&lt;/em&gt; is to deconstruct, question, and redefine through a critical lens what is commonly understood as &quot;migration crises.&quot; The volume covers a wide range of historical, economic, social, political, and environmental conditions that generate migration crises around the globe. At the same time, it illuminates how the media and public officials play a major role in framing migratory flows as crises. The volume brings together an exceptional group of scholars from around the world to critically examine migration crises and to revisit the notion of crisis through the context in which permanent and non-permanent migration flows occur.
&lt;em&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Migration Crises&lt;/em&gt; offers an understanding of individuals in societies, socio-economic structures, and group processes. Focusing on migrants&#39; departures and arrivals in all continents, this comprehensive handbook explores the social dynamics of migration crises, with an emphasis on factors that propel these flows as well as the actors that play a role in classifying them and in addressing them. The volume is organized into nine sections. The first section provides a historical overview of the link between migration and crises. The second looks at how migration crises are constructed, while the third section contextualizes the causes and effects of protracted conflicts in producing crises. The fourth focuses on the role of climate and the environment in generating migration crises, while the fifth section examines these migratory flows in migration corridors and transit countries. The sixth section looks at policy responses to migratory flows, The last three sections look at the role media and visual culture, gender, and  immigrant incorporation play in migration crises." />
