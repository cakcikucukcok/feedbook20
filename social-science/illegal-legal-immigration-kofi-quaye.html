  <title>Illegal, Legal Immigration - Kofi Quaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will inform and educate the general public on illegal immigration and its effects not only on those directly involved in the process, but on the general population as well. Writing about it in the context of its impact on contemporary society seems to be the best way to do it. How the different media view it, the degree to which the public has been influenced to view the question of immigration in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are included in the issues discussed, analyzed and elaborated on, as we attempt to look at the process of immigration, legal and illegal, from the standpoint of its impact on society as a whole.
 If some of the stories seem to be familiar, it is because the people are real, and the things they talk about actually happened. They are essentially true stories told by people who want to share their real-life experiences. Only in a few instances have names been changed to protect the identities of those involved." />
