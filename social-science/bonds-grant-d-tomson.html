  <title>Bonds - Grant. D. Tomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world as we know it, has changed.  A global cataclysmic event has wiped out 95% of the population resulting in the total ruin of our infrastructures.  A group of six friends struggle for day to day survival until the eventful day they stumble across an ancient Pagan tome during one of their raids; but they are not the only ones with such a book. Telepathy, telekinesis and the likes, once believed to be fictitious, are now a reality. Two other clans, larger in number, step forward in an attempt to annihilate our heroes for the ultimate quest of power. The fast paced, action packed events that follow cause Daeron, the leader of Kvartz, to put aside his love and adoration for Sky and focus on getting them through this saga.  Can Daeron do what needs to be done, to destroy his opponents, or will he instead sacrifice his life for theirs?" />
