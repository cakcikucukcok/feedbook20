  <title>Remapping Second-Wave Feminism: The Long Women&#39;s Rights Movement in Louisiana, 1950-1997 - Janet Allured</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scholars of second-wave feminism often center their research on northern thought and political activity and usually overlook the vibrant pockets of activism that existed elsewhere. In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Remapping Second-Wave Feminism&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Janet Allured attempts to reshape the national narrative by focusing on the grassroots women&amp;#8217;s movement in the South, particularly in Louisiana.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This book delves into unexplored origins of the feminist movement. While acknowledging the ways that the fight for African American civil rights produced the women&amp;#8217;s liberation movement in the South&amp;#8212;and subsequently in the North&amp;#8212;Allured also locates other wellsprings of the movement that were particularly important to southern change-seekers, especially preexisting women&amp;#8217;s organizations such as the League of Women Voters and the YWCA. Also, for many southern feminists, being part of a faith tradition that emphasized social justice reform is what ultimately propelled them into working for gender equality. Allured highlights key figures in Louisiana; divisions based on regional, sexual, and ideological differences; access to abortion; lawsuits that had national implications that emanated from southern women; and the fight against sexual assault and domestic violence. Through detailed archival and oral history research, she has forged a new path, making this a foundational work for the field. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Remapping Second-Wave Feminism&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; will amend how we reflexively view feminism as a northern phenomenon, giving proper due to the southern contribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
