  <title>The Last Bohemia - Robert Anasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A firsthand account of the swift transformation of Williamsburg, from factory backwater to artists&#39; district to trendy hub and high-rise colony&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is now so synonymous with hipster culture and the very idea of urban revitalization--so well-known from Chicago to Cambodia as &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;playground for the game of ironized status-seeking and lifestyle one-upmanship--that it&#39;s easy to forget how just a few years ago it was a very different neighborhood: a spread of factories, mean streets and ratty apartments that the rest of New York City feared and everyone but artists with nowhere else to go left alone. &lt;br&gt;     Robert Anasi hasn&#39;t forgotten. He moved to a $300-a-month apartment in Williamsburg in 1994, and watched as the area went through a series of surreal transformations: the warehouses became lofts, secret cocaine bars became sylized absinthe parlors, barrooms became stage sets for inde-rock careers and rents rose and rose--until the local artists found that their ideal of personal creativity had served the aims of global commerce, and that their neighborhood now belonged to someone else. &lt;br&gt;     Tight, passionate, and provocative, &lt;i&gt;The Last Bohemia &lt;/i&gt;is at once a celebration of the fever dream of bohemia, a lament for what Williamsburg has become and a cautionary tale about the lurching transformations of city neighborhoods throughout the United States.&lt;/p&gt;" />
