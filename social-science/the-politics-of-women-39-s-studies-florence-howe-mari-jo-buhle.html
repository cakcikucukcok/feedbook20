  <title>The Politics of Women&#39;s Studies - Florence Howe, Mari Jo Buhle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In the patriarchal halls of 1970s academe, women who spoke their minds risked their careers. Yet intrepid women&amp;#151;students, faculty, administrators, members of the community&amp;#151;persisted in collaborating to form women&#39;s studies. In doing so, they created a movement that altered curricula and teaching styles, and shifted paradigms and content across disciplines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These original essays by &quot;founding mothers&quot; feature a diversity of voices: young graduate students or new PhD&#39;s just beginning to teach and untenured; tenured professors in search of ways to improve their students&#39; capacities to learn; older, veteran academics at last witnessing change; and even a few administrators. In all of these programs, founders grappled not only with issues of gender, but with those of class, race, and sexuality, in a decade infused with political unrest and questioning, when civil rights and anti-war activism, as well as feminism, shaped academic worlds.&lt;/div&gt;" />
