  <title>A Year at the Helm of the United Nations General Assembly - Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, Ban Ki-moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From September 2011 to September 2012,
Ambassador Nasser Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar presided over the 66th session
of the &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8217;s parliament&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; the United Nations General Assembly. It was a
critical moment in international affairs as the UN responded to a range of
global challenges, from the world financial crisis to the Arab Spring. In &lt;em&gt;A
Year at the Helm of the General Assembly&lt;/em&gt;, Al-Nasser presents a high-level
look inside the organization, assessing its strengths and weaknesses, its
successes and struggles. He recounts dramatic moments, such as replacing the
Libyan delegation, and a tireless schedule of overseas travel, including joint
visits with the Secretary-General to Libya and Somalia. His work takes him from
major international summits such as the Conference on Sustainable Development
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Rio+20) to the European Parliament, which he was the
first General Assembly President to address, to academic institutions from
Oxford to Moscow to Morocco.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Al-Nasser
structures the book as he did his 66th session, around four main
themes or &amp;#8220;pillars:&amp;#8221; mediation, UN reform, natural disaster prevention and
response, and sustainable development.He offers a wide range of recommendations to intergovernmental
institutions, to states, to the public sector, and to individuals. Al-Nasser was determined to leave behind
a General Assembly that the people of the world could look up to and depend on.
This volume is a testament to all that he accomplished in that regard, and a
unique resource for those interested in knowing more about the world&amp;#8217;s most
representative body at a crucial moment in history.
