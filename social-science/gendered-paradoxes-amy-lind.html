  <title>Gendered Paradoxes - Amy Lind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the early 1980s Ecuador has experienced a series of events unparalleled in its history. Its &amp;ldquo;free market&amp;rdquo; strategies exacerbated the debt crisis, and in response new forms of social movement organizing arose among the country&amp;rsquo;s poor, including women&amp;rsquo;s groups. &lt;em&gt;Gendered Paradoxes&lt;/em&gt; focuses on women&amp;rsquo;s participation in the political and economic restructuring process of the past twenty-five years, showing how in their daily struggle for survival Ecuadorian women have both reinforced and embraced the neoliberal model yet also challenged its exclusionary nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on her extensive ethnographic fieldwork and employing an approach combining political economy and cultural politics, Amy Lind charts the growth of several strands of women&amp;rsquo;s activism and identifies how they have helped redefine, often in contradictory ways, the real and imagined boundaries of neoliberal development discourse and practice. In her analysis of this ambivalent and &amp;ldquo;unfinished&amp;rdquo; cultural project of modernity in the Andes, she examines state policies and their effects on women of various social sectors; women&amp;rsquo;s community development initiatives and responses to the debt crisis; and the roles played by feminist &amp;ldquo;issue networks&amp;rdquo; in reshaping national and international policy agendas in Ecuador and in developing a transnationally influenced, locally based feminist movement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
