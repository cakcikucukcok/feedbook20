  <title>Dominant Wives Society and Their Cuckold Husbands Volume 8 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I parked the car in the airport parking lot and walked to the baggage claim and waited for Irene to come down the escalator.     Then my jaw dropped. Someone who resembled my wife began to descend the escalator with all eyes on her. A woman with fiery red hair cut into a short shoulder length bob with bangs, dressed in a short red mini dress that was barely covering her ass, wearing red high heels and black sunglasses, graciously floated down to the baggage claim area.  But, what I noticed the most was that her breasts were huge! I&#39;m not too familiar with bra cup sizes but I think my wife wore a B cup. What she had now easily had to be a DD cup size. Her breasts bounced as she began to walk very sexily in her high heels.    As she approached me, she was wearing a smile and then it faded. Like she was remembering her old life or something and that I was still part of it somehow, whether she wanted me to be or not." />
