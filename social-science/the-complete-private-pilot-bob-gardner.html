  <title>The Complete Private Pilot - Bob Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Taking and passing an FAA Knowledge Exam is required for earning the Private Pilot, Sport Pilot, and Recreational Pilot certificates. Using the FAA exam as the premise for learning, author Bob Gardner applies practical information so readers are not only prepared for the tests, but also for the cockpit. He augments the required aeronautical knowledge by giving specific tips and techniques, checklists, mnemonic devices, and sound advice from personal experience. A full-color example of a sectional chart is provided in the back for use with the interactive exercises throughout the book. Each chapter concludes with sample FAA Knowledge Exam questions. A comprehensive glossary and index are included as well. This practical application of the FAA Knowledge Exam is not available in any other text!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Included in this Twelfth Edition are internet links for useful aviation websites, weather charts, flight planning, etc., with a section showing examples of online weather sources and more (with full-color examples of weather chart products). Also included is information on the new ICAO-based flight planning form, scenario-based training, single-pilot resource management, and learner-centered grading. This is a convenient, comprehensive source for this information&amp;#151;everything complete in one book!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Gardner&#39;s approachable yet concise writing style, readers are able to quickly grasp the subjects, pass the required tests and checkrides, and gain an operational understanding of flight they can take straight to the cockpit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Complete Private Pilot&lt;/I&gt; works as a companion textbook to ASA&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Private Pilot Virtual Test Prep&lt;/I&gt; DVD Ground School. An integrated Flight/Ground Syllabus for both Part 141 and 61 programs is also available to accompany the textbook. Foreword by Richard Taylor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
