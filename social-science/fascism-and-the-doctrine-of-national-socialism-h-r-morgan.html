  <title>Fascism, and the Doctrine of National Socialism - H.R. Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What this all adds up to is the re-establishment of freedom.  Freedom to be ourselves; to have the right to our feelings;  to have the right to our own thoughts; to have the right to free speech whatever it is that we have to say and to say it whenever and wherever we find ourselves.  To have the right to see the truth in all things as we are able to perceive it.  To deliberately recognize the reality that surrounds us as we engage in the continual struggle for genuineness.
   Keeping it real is good for all people; without this faculty fantasy and prevarication takes over.  Our culture is our social environment.  We need to have the power and the will to protect it.  It is the womb of our civilization.  Our innately personal ideals as well as our interpersonal social norms, mores, and colloquialisations  our national integrity is being cancelled out by the corrupt regime in Congress and the Federal courts.
   We all have the right to live within the society and culture we were born into at the very least; the right to our own individuality, to our own opinions and to express our love of who and what we are.  Unfortunately, the current phase that the Federal government has lapsed into is one of denying all of these rights to the degree that the Bill of Rights is superseded.  Citizenship has become superfluous. It is time to get radical.  It is past time for citizens to revolt.  Otherwise this will soon become no different than any other oppressed country with the federal tyranny of the D. C. Treason Regime.                        HRM" />
