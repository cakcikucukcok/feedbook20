  <title>Found Cheating: Sara Makes Tina Serve As Her Personal Slave Girl Volume 1 Thru 3 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tina went to grab for Sara, but fell to the ground. Her towel came off and she was on her knees reaching for Sara naked. &quot;Please Sara, don&#39;t tell anyone!&quot; She begged.     Sara stopped and looked down at Tina who had a pleading look on her face. &quot;Please, I can&#39;t get expelled, I just can&#39;t.&quot; She paused and continued, &quot;You can stay here, and I won&#39;t kick you out.&quot;     Sara looked at Tina and saw her sexy naked body. She got turned on and felt herself getting excited. &quot;Also...&quot;     &quot;Anything.&quot; Tina interrupted, &quot;I will do anything.&quot; She pleaded. Remembering what her father had told her. She had to graduate Yale before she could have access to her father&#39;s millions. If she got expelled, she would never see one dime of that money. She was desperate. &quot;I will do anything.&quot; She said in a meek voice. &quot;Anything.&quot;     &quot;From now on, you will do everything I tell you to do for my entertainment and amusement. Do you understand?&quot; She asked Tina.     &quot;Yes. I will do everything you say.&quot; Tina agreed." />
